<h2>ROM Files</h2>
<p>
To run the Visicom COM-100 emulator the ROM dump from the original Victory should be specified in the 'ROM' field. Default Visicom ROM location is the Visicom directory (located in the application data directory, see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>) and the default filename is 'visicom.rom'. To change the location use the 'ROM' button to browse for the file, do the same to change the filename or type in a new file name in the text field.
</p>
<p>
The binary, Intel hex and RCS Elf Emulator hex format are supported.
</p>
<p>
Similar as for the main ROM any cartridge ROM can be specified via the 'CART' button. Only one Visicom cartridge is currently available: cas-130. This cartridge includes: baseball and Sumo Wrestling. To start baseball press 'X' (0 on keyboard A) and to start Sumo Wrestling press 'W' (5 on keyboard A). The baseball game is the same as the Studio II baseball cartridge as described in chapter Baseball in <a href="StudioCartridges.htm">Cartridges</a>.
