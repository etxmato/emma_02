This option is only implemented for the VIP2K Membership Card & Membership Card and can be used in combination with the monitor software. When using the Membership Card make sure a configuration is load, for details see <a href="MembershipMain.htm">Membership Card</a>. Settings for the LOAD/SAVE feature are shown in GUI below.

<h2>Auto LOAD/SAVE</h2>
<p>
Auto LOAD/SAVE is the default settings; if that is not loaded make sure 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' is checked (yellow ellipse).
</p>
<p>
To load a terminal file into the emulated computer, select a file (orange ellipse). Start the load command by pressing 'L' or 'I' (on the emulated computer).
</p>
<p>
To save a terminal file from the emulated computer, select a file (orange ellipse). Start the save command by pressing 'S' or 'C' (on the emulated computer). For the Membership Card: when the save is finished the front panel LEDs should flash on / off, at that time press a key in the video terminal window.
</p>
<p>
For both save and load make sure a file is selected (orange ellipse) before using the save and load instructions otherwise the emulated computer will hang on the load (until you manually start a file) or with a save the terminal ouotput will not be written to any file.
</p>
<h2>Manual LOAD/SAVE</h2>
<p>
To use this make sure 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' is NOT checked (yellow ellipse). This setting is more like the terminal LOAD/SAVE handling with the real monitor.
