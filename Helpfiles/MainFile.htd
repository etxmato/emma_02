<h1>Directory and File Structure</h1>
<p>
After initial start-up of Emma 02 a default directory and file structure will be made available according to the sub chapters below. These files can be re-installed at any time with the menu option below (yellow ellipse): 
</p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="images/dir_reinstall_sw_files.png" BORDER="0">
</p>
<p>
The location for the data directory is default set to:
</p>
<UL>
<LI>Windows Vista and later: C:\\Users\\<I>username</I>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Emma 02
<LI>XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\<I>username</I>\\Application Data\\Emma 02
<LI>Mac OSX: ~/Emma 02
<LI>Linux: ~/emma_02_data
</UL>
<p>
Note that when an older versions of Emma 02 was used previously the default data directory might be set to:
</p>
<UL>
<LI>Mac OSX: ~/Documents/emma_02
<LI>Linux: ~/Documents/emma_02
</UL>
</p>
<p>
To change the location of these files use the menu item below:
</p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="images/menu_change_data_dir.png" BORDER="0">
</p>
<p>
A small window will open where with the 'browse' button (yellow ellipse) a new location can be selected. After this 2 options are available: either to only save the new location ('Save' button, orange ellipse) or save and move the existing data directory and files to the new location ('Move & Save' button, blue ellipse). If the save only option is used the data folder should be moved manually. When moving the folder to another disk the process could take a few minutes (depending on the disk speed). In all cases all settings will be set to default as in the ''Set Default (All)' menu action.
</p>

<p>
<B>Note:</B> When installing a new version of Emma 02 the data directory will NOT be re-installed automatically to avoid overwriting changes made by users. To install all the latest files from the Emma 02 installation package follow the instructions at the top of this page.
