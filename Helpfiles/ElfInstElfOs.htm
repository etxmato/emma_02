<h2>Installation Elf/Os 2.8</h2>
<p>
Elf Os is a disk based operating system for Elf class computers designed by Mike Riley, for additional information see also: <a href="http://www.elf-emulation.com">Elf/1802 Emulation</a>.
</p>
<p>
During installation the following .ide files are already installed including Elf/Os 2.8: 
<UL>
<LI>pixie-installation.ide
<LI>mc6845-installation.ide
<LI>mc6847-installation.ide
<LI>tms-installation.ide
<LI>gra-installation.ide
<LI>serial-installation.ide
<LI>vt100-installation.ide.
</UL>
These files include a pre installed Elf/Os and additional Elf/Os software. The installation files will be renamed to pixie.ide, mc6845.ide, mc6847.ide, tms.ide, gra.ide, serial.ide or vt100.ide if the used file doesn't exist.
</p>
<p>
The following example will install Elf/Os 2.8 via a vt100 terminal. To change video output after installation follow the procedure <a href="ElfInstBiosio.htm">Installation Biosio</a> afterwards. 
</p>
<p>
Load the Elf/Os 2.8 installation configuration via the 'File/Configuration/Elf/Os - Installation/2.8 - Serial I/O' menu or use:<br>
</p>
<pre>
ROM 1: bios.1.0.4.rom 
RAM 2: elfos.0.2.8.hex 
IDE: (any filename).ide 
Disk Type: IDE; with 512 Tracks, 4 Heads and 26 Sectors 
Boot address: 9000

Uppercase: selected</pre>
<p>
To start installation of Elf/Os follow these steps:
</p>
<h3>
