<h1>PL-80 Plotter Simulation</h1>
<p>
To run the COMX emulator with COMX PL-80 Plotter simulation select f&m.printer.1.2.bin or printer.bin in any available slot (CARD 1 if no expansion box is used), see example below (yellow ellipse):

For details on configuring other printer types, see <a href="ComxPrinter.htm">Parallel Printer Support</a>, <a href="ComxSerialPrinter.htm">Serial Printer Support</a> and <a href="ComxThermal.htm">Thermal Printer Support</a>.
</p>
<h2>Plotting to File</h2>
<p>
To send all plot commands to a file select 'File' in the selection box next to the printer output file name (orange ellipse). When a 'printer on' command is send with a CARD P3 (if an <a href="ComxExpansion.htm">expansion box</a> is configured) or a CALL (@C070) a plot file is created (as specified in the orange ellipse). If the indicated plot file already exists a new file is created with the next sequence number. E.g. if the plot file is 'printerout.txt', this file is used the first time, after a CARD P1 (printer off) and a CARD P3 (printer on) the file printerout.1.txt' will be created.
</p>
<p>
From the COMX Emulator activate the PL-80 Plotter via the parallel printer commands (see also <a href="ComxPrinter.htm">Parallel Printer Support</a>) or load a '.comx' file from the Plotter directory to start a demo program.
</p>
<h2>Plotting to Screen and or Printer</h2>
<p>
To plot to an output screen and/or to a real printer, first select 'Plot' (orange ellipse):
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
After this send a 'printer on' command from the COMX or open the plotter output screen manually. A 'printer on' command from the COMX can be done with a CARD P3 (if an <a href="ComxExpansion.htm">expansion box</a> is configured) or a CALL (@C070). To open the output screen manually, press the F4 button or the printer icon (blue ellipse) before giving printer commands from the COMX.
</p>

</p>
<p>
When the plotter output screen opens, the print, preview and setup buttons will be disabled. When the COMX is ready with the drawing and a CARD P1 or CALL (@C050) is given these buttons will be enabled (yellow ellipse). After this it is possible to use the print button to send the plotter output to a real printer, use preview and/or change printer settings. 
</p>
<p>
To start a new drawing close the plotter output screen. After this a new plotter window will be created when the COMX starts the first output to the plotter.
</p>
<p>
The plotter system ROM file can be changed via the controls in the orange ellipse and the character ROM file via the controls in the blue ellipse.
</p>
<p>
From the COMX Emulator activate the PL-80 Plotter via the parallel printer commands (see also <a href="ComxPrinter.htm">Parallel Printer Support</a>) or load a '.comx' file from the Plotter directory to start a demo program.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to disable the COMX status LEDs by clicking one of the LEDs, a red cross shows the LEDs are disabled (yellow ellipse). This will speed up printout especially when using higher CPU speeds.

<h2>System and Character ROMs</h2>
<p>
The installation includes a plotter system rom file (pl80.bin) with the original character font set, as well as 2 additional font ROMs: Italic, Emphasized and Outline (pl80.it.em.ou.bin) and Tiny (pl80.tiny.bin). The first font rom also includes 2 sets designed for use with MSX computers. To access the fonts use code '12' and character set:
</p>
<pre>
0. Original PL-80 Pica font (character 32 to 255)</pre>
<p>
With the italic font rom selected:
</p>
<pre>
1. Italic font
2. Emphasized font
3. Outline font
4. MSX font (character 1 to 31, by adding 32)
5. MSX font (character 32 to 255)</pre>
<p>
<p>
With the tiny font rom selected:
</p>
<pre>
1. Tiny font</pre>
<p>
An example is also included to print the different character sets, see the file 'Fonts.comx' in the 'Comx/Plotter' directory.
