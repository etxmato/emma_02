The Device Port window includes all input and output ports as well as EF flags for for all supported Pico HW extensions. All input/output ports can be defined from 1 to 7 depending on what the software expects and what HW you want to emulate. Controls will be disabled for all HW that is not configured.

The EF flags can be specified from 1 to 4 except for the printer EF (yellow ellipse) which also allows value 0. In this case 0 indicates that no EF flag is used for when the printer is ready to receive data.
</p>
<p>
The most common values for all device ports are defined as default.

Note that no input/output port or EF flag should have the same value if the extension is used at the same time.

To save the defined device port configuration, click the 'Save' button (magenta ellipse).
