<h2>Disk File</h2>
<p>
The IDE file can be specified by using the IDE button. Default 'elf2k.ide' is used but this can be changed to any file name. Number of tracks, heads and sectors can be specified for the IDE type, default is 512 tracks, 4 heads and 26 sectors (changeable via Device Port button).

After initial start-up the file elf2k-installation.ide is made available including a pre installed Elf/Os and additional Elf/Os software. The installation file will be renamed to elf2k.ide if that file doesn't exist.
