<h2>Keyboard Mapping</h2>
<p>
Default the TMC-600 will start-up with Caps Lock on. Just press Caps Lock to go back to normal mode. Note all TMC-600 BASIC commands should be given in capitals. On Mac OSX the TMC-600 will start-up with Caps lock on, however this will not be refelected by the PC caps lock light.
</p>
<p>
The 'F12' key can be used to simulate the TMC-600 run switch, i.e. when 'F12' is pressed the TMC-600 will stop execution and when pressed again it will restart. See also <a href="MainFunctionKeys.htm">Function and Hot Keys</a>.
</p>
<p>
Default CTRL and ALT keys are mapped to the TMC-600 left CTRL and left ALT buttons. To switch this to right CTRL and right ALT press the TAB key once. Next press will switch back to left.
</p>
<p>
Key mapping towards the TMC-600 will most likely not be 100% towards any PC keyboard, this is due to the handling of the handling of the keyboard and especially the SHIFT key. For example if the '=' is not under SHIFT on the PC keyboard (probably most keyboards) the TMC-600 emulation will not be able to handle an '=' on the right key as it needs it 'under SHIFT'. 
</p>
<p>Most special keys can be changed via the 'Key Map' button which will show a window with all keys listed. To make a change first select a button. After this 'Press Key' is shown on the button; now press the PC key it should be mapped to. Any PC key that is mapped twice will be shown in a red colour, avoid double mapping as the emulator will not be able to handle this. 
</p>
<p>
To 'clear' a key, if it is not needed, press the space bar. This can be used for double characters like @ or ^ as these are both mapped to regular and SHIFT keys.
</p>
<p>
In case a SHIFT key is pressed for a regular key (or the other way around) 'invalid key' will be shown. 
</p>
<p>
The default key map setting is optimized for a US keyboard, which can be changed via menu 'Settings / Default Keyboard'. For non defined keyboards user defined settings can be defined as described in chapter 'Default Keyboard' in <a href="MainHexKeyMap.htm">Key Mapping</a>
