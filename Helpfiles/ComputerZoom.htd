<h1>Zoom Level and Full Screen Mode</h1>
<p>
All emulators supporting one or more video outputs, include the option to change the zoom level and/or switch to full screen mode, using the following controls:

<p>

</p>
<p>
Default setting is 1 or 2 (depending on the emulated video type) where every actual dot of the emulated video screen is the same size (1) or twice the size (2) on the PC screen. The zoom level value can be specified from 0.5 and upwards (depending on PC screen size and resolution).
</p>
<p>
To change the zoom level fill in the desired value (highlighted in green), use the spin buttons or just resize the emulated window by dragging the bottom right corner. 
</p>
<p>
If a computer configuration contains multiple video outputs the switch button (highlighted in blue) will be enabled. The selected video type is shown in the text field (highlighted in orange). The zoom and full screen features will be active for the selected/shown video type.
</p>
<p>
The zoom level for the video terminal is specified with dedicated buttons within the 'Terminal' field (highlighted in purple), see also section <a href="TerminalSetup.htm">Terminal Setup</a>.
</p>
<p>
Zooming is possible either with or without using a 'floating point' value. Default setting is using floating point values, this can be changed for all emulated computers via menu item below. A larger part of the screen or window will be used when using floating point values. Note, more PC processor load will be used, so if the screen emulation is too slow unselect the 'floating point' zooming.

<p>
Switching between window mode and full screen mode can be done by pressing F3 from the emulated computer window, the 'Full Screen' button (highlighted in yellow) or via the Setting/Window menu option. When a Video Terminal and video emulation are used simultaneously (e.g. on a VElf or Cosmicos) the video terminal will switch to full screen first, pressing F3 again will switch the specified video emulation to full screen.
