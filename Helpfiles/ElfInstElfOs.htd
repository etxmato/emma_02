<body>
<h1>Installation Elf/Os 2.8</h1>
<p>
Elf Os is a disk based operating system for Elf class computers designed by Mike Riley, for additional information see also: <a href="http://www.elf-emulation.com">Elf/1802 Emulation</a>.
</p>
<p>
During installation the following .ide files are already installed including Elf/Os 2.8: 
<UL>
<LI>pixie-installation.ide
<LI>mc6845-installation.ide
<LI>mc6847-installation.ide
<LI>tms-installation.ide
<LI>gra-installation.ide
<LI>serial-installation.ide
<LI>vt100-installation.ide.
</UL>
These files include a pre installed Elf/Os and additional Elf/Os software. The installation files will be renamed to pixie.ide, mc6845.ide, mc6847.ide, tms.ide, gra.ide, serial.ide or vt100.ide if the used file doesn't exist.
</p>
<p>
The following example will install Elf/Os 2.8 via a vt100 terminal. To change video output after installation follow the procedure <a href="ElfInstBiosio.htm">Installation Biosio</a> afterwards. 
</p>
<p>
To start installation, first load the configuration with the menu option below (blue square) following the grey menu:
</p>
<p>

RAM 2: elfos.0.2.8.hex 
IDE: (any filename).ide 
Disk Type: IDE; with 512 Tracks, 4 Heads and 26 Sectors 
Boot address: 9000

<p>
To start installation of Elf/Os follow these steps:
</p>
<h2>
1. Press start
</h2>
<p>
This should start one of the Elf computer windows and a Vt100 window, press the return button in the Vt100 window which will set the baud rate and should after this show this menu: 
</p>
<pre>
   Elf/Os Installation
   1> Run hard drive init tool
   2> Run filesystem gen tool
   3> Run sys tool
   4> Install binaries
   5> Boot Elf/OS

      Option ?</pre>
<p>
<h2>
2. Select option 1> Run hard drive init tool
</h2>
<p>
Choose Q for Quick format, which will initialize the hard drive. When the init is complete, you should see something similar to: 
<pre>
   Total Sectors: 53248
   Format Complete</pre>
<p>
After this the menu will be redrawn. 
</p>
<p>
Note: This step only needs to be performed once. If you have already run the hard drive init tool on your emulated drives, you will never need to run it again. 
<h2>
3. Select option 2> Run filesystem gen tool
</h2>
<p>
This will setup the filesystem on the disk. After running this step you should see something similar to: 
<pre>
  IDE File System Gen Utility

  AU Size: 8
  Total AUs: 6656
  Master Dir Sector: 48
  Filesystem generation complete</pre>
<p>
After which you again get the installation menu.
</p>
<p>
Note: This step you also normally need to run only once. You would only need to run this option again if you desire to wipe out the contents of your drive. 
<h2>
4. Select option 3> Run sys tool
</h2>
<p>
This will copy the OS kernel to the hard disk. You should see: 
<pre>
  System copied.</pre>
