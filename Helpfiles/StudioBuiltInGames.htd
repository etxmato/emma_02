<h2>Built in Games</h2>
<p>
Brief instructions on how to play the built in games are described in the chapters below. These instructions need 'Auto Arcade Key Definition' selected which is the default setting. For more details about arcade keys see chapter <a href="KeyMappingArcade.htm">Auto and Arcade Key Definition</a>.
</p>
<p>
Definitions below assume you are using a numeric keypad and have selected menu item 'Settings / Use Numeric Keypad'. If this option is not selected correct key is indicated in (). Note that for player B keys W, A, S, Z for directions and TAB for fire will work both with and without the 'Use Numeric Keypad' setting selected.
</p>
<h3>Doodle</h3>
<p>
Press 1 to start, a white dot will appear in the lower left corner. Move the dot by pressing any of the arrow keys (or numpad 1 to 9). Note that pressing two arrow key simultaneously will move diagonally.
</p>
<p>
Press numpad 5 (TAB) to start drawing, press space (or numpad 0) to erase.
</p>
<p>
By combining the functions of Doodle and Pattern, you can reverse the image, making your Doodle turn from a white drawing on a black background to a black drawing on a white background. Or, make just part of the screen white. You can even start another pattern and have the Studio II print over your Doodle. Here's how: After you finish your Doodle, press 2. To reverse the image first press the right arrow key. Then press space or numpad 0 and the screen will start to 'paint' itself white, making the Doodle black. If allowed to continue, the screen will become black again. You can 'freeze' the picture any time by pressing numpad 5 (TAB) and start it again with space or numpad 0. Studio II will form other patterns over your Doodle by following the Pattern instructions below.
</p>
<h3>Patterns</h3>
<p>
Press 2 to start. No dot will appear until an entry is made. Form a simple basic design with the arrow keys (or numpad 1 to 9). Note that pressing two arrow key simultaneously will move diagonally. To erase part of your design just trace back over it. When your design is ready press space or numpad 0 and watch the Studio II form the pattern by repeating your design over and over. 
</p>
<p>
To 'freeze' pattern press numpad 5 (TAB) and restart with space or numpad 0.
</p>
<p>
After 130 key entries the Studio II will start forming a pattern even if no space is pressed.
