<h1>Cassette Support</h1>
<p>
The common functionality for cassette handling is described in the chapter <a href="MainCassette.htm">Cassette Support</a>. For details on how to use a real cassette player connected to a PC and Emma 02 please see the chapter: <a href="MainRealCassette.htm">Real Cassette Support</a>
</p>
<p>
The following sub chapter describe COMX specific cassette handling for both automatic and manual options.
</p>
<h2>Auto LOAD/SAVE</h2>
<p>
To use this option 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' should be checked (yellow ellipse) which is the default setting:
</p>

</p>
<p>
To load a .wav file into the COMX type PLOAD or DLOAD (and return) in the COMX emulator window and the cassette play button (green ellipse) will go green.
</p>
<p>
To save a .wav file from the COMX type PSAVE or DSAVE (and return) in the COMX emulator window and the cassette record button (red ellipse) should go red. 
</p>
<p>
For both save and load make sure a .wav file is selected before using the PSAVE and PLOAD instructions otherwise the COMX emulator will hang on the PLOAD (until you manually start a .wav file) or with a PSAVE the wav sound will not be written to any file. The play, record and stop buttons cannot be used for manual intervention unless 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' is unselected. 
</p>
<h3>Manual LOAD/SAVE</h3>
<p>
To use this option 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' should NOT be checked. This setting is more like the cassette handling is on the real COMX however a bit more complicated than Auto LOAD/SAVE:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
To load a .wav file into the COMX, type PLOAD or DLOAD in the COMX emulator (don't type return as yet!). Press play (green ellipse) and after that as soon as possible press 'return' on the COMX.
</p>
<p>
To save a .wav file from the COMX, press the dark red record button (red ellipse) and type PSAVE or DSAVE (and return) in the COMX.
</p>
<p>
Saving or loading can be stopped at anytime by pressing the stop button (brown ellipse). When stopping a load while the COMX is in loading mode will however hang the COMX.
</p>
<h3>COMX Turbo and TOS loaders</h3>
<p>
The emulator includes '.comx' files for the F&M Turbo v1.00, v2.00 and F&M TOS v3.00. All these Turbo and TOS loaders (including the Turbo and Turbo+ commands available in the F&M printer rom) also support Auto and Turbo LOAD/SAVE options as described above.
