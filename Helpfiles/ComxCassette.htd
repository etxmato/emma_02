<h1>Cassette Support</h1>
<p>
The common functionality for cassette handling is described in the section <a href="ComputerCassette.htm">Cassette Support</a>. For details on how to use a real cassette player connected to a PC and Emma 02 please see the section: <a href="ComputerRealCassette.htm">Real Cassette Support</a>.
</p>
<p>
The following sub section describe COMX specific cassette handling for both automatic and manual options as well as batch wav conversion.
</p>
<p>
The emulator includes '.comx' files for the F&M Turbo v1.00, v2.00 and F&M TOS v3.00. All Turbo and TOS loaders (including the Turbo and Turbo+ commands available in the F&M printer rom) also support Auto and Turbo LOAD/SAVE options as described below.
</p>
<h2>Auto LOAD/SAVE</h2>
<p>
To use this option 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' should be checked (highlighted in yellow) which is the default setting:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
To load a .wav file into the COMX type PLOAD or DLOAD (and return) in the COMX emulator window and the cassette play button (highlighted in green) will go green.
</p>
<p>
To save a .wav file from the COMX type PSAVE or DSAVE (and return) in the COMX emulator window and the cassette record button (highlighted in red) will go red. 
</p>
<p>
For both save and load make sure a .wav file is selected before using the PSAVE and PLOAD instructions otherwise the COMX emulator will hang on the PLOAD (until you manually start a .wav file) or with a PSAVE the wav sound will not be written to any file. The play, record and stop buttons cannot be used for manual intervention unless 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' is unselected. 
</p>
<h3>Manual LOAD/SAVE</h3>
<p>
To use this option 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' should NOT be checked. This setting is more like the cassette handling is on the real COMX however a bit more complicated than Auto LOAD/SAVE:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
To load a .wav file into the COMX, type PLOAD or DLOAD in the COMX emulator (don't type return as yet!). Press play (highlighted in green) and after that as soon as possible press 'return' on the COMX.
</p>
<p>
To save a .wav file from the COMX, press the dark red record button (highlighted in red) and type PSAVE or DSAVE (and return) in the COMX.
</p>
<p>
Saving or loading can be stopped at anytime by pressing the stop button (highlighted in brown). When stopping a load while the COMX is in loading mode will however hang the COMX.
</p>
<h3>Batch wav conversion</h3>
<p>
The 'Batch - wav' feature converts a number of selected .comx files to wav files by instructing the COMX emulator to save them to wav format one by one. To use this function first select the files that need to be converted via the multi file selector window that will open after clicking the 'Batch - wav' button (highlighted in yellow):
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The number of files selected should show to the right of the Convert button. Before starting the conversion make sure a COMX emultator is started and then press the 'Convert' button (highlighted in orange). Then wait until the COMX finalizes all needed PSAVE commands.
</p>
<p>
Note: pure machine code .comx files (first byte = 1) are not supported (as they are not saveable with PSAVE).
