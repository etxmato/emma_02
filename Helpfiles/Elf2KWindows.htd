<h2>Control Windows</h2>
<p>
3 types of Elf 2000 control windows can be emulated. The main board, switch panel and hex panel. Note the switch and hex panel can not be emulated simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
The main board includes the status LEDs and TIL311 displays. Emulation of the TIL311 displays and the LEDs can take a lot of PC CPU power so default these are only updated every 100 ms. This can be changed in the Emma 02 window by changing the 'LEDs' field. When 0 ms (or nothing) is specified the TIL311 displays and LEDs will be updated in real time. Note that the SC0 and SC1 LEDs are not emulated also due to PC CPU power needs.
