Selecting the 'Log' checkbox (blue ellipse) will switch on a video log. All output to video will also be recorded in a debug.log file stored in the application data directory (see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>). If the indicated log file already exists a new file is created with the next sequence number. (i.e. debug.log, debug.1.log, debug.2.log etc.)
