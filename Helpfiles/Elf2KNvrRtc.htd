<h3>NVR</h3>
<p>
Elf 2000 non-volatile main memory is supported. To turn this feature off, unselect the 'NVR' check box (red ellipse).
</p>
<p>
To clear main memory at start-up, select the RAM 'Clear' check box (blue ellipse). After start-up the emulator will automatically unselect the checkbox.

<h3>DS12887 NVR / RTC</h3>
<p>
The DS12887 NVR and RTC are supported, RTC by providing the PC time and date at all times. Both can be switched off by unselecting the DS NVR/RTC check box (yellow ellipse).
</p>
<p>
To clear DS12887 NVR at start-up, select the DS NVR 'Clear' check box (orange ellipse). After start-up the emulator will automatically unselect the checkbox.
</p>
<p>
Note that not all DS12887 features are emulated. Currently the real time clock is loaded with the PC clock values every second and the 15 divider stages will set the PF bit in register C with the specified frequency based directly on the emulated 1802 processor speed.
