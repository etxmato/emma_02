<h2>Pre SW Load</h2>
<p>
To run the VIP2K Membership Card emulator with SW loaded before the emulator starts select the SW file in the 'RAM SW' field. To change the location use the 'RAM SW' button to browse for the file, do the same to change the filename or type in a new file name in the text field.
</p>
<p>
The selected file will be loaded at RAM address 8000 (if the file is binary, other formats like intel hex will be loaded at the specified locations).
</p>
<p>
The binary, Intel hex and RCS Elf Emulator hex format are supported.
</p>
<p>
Files can also be loaded in RAM in run time, either by using the Memory Access buttons or via the VIP2K montior L or BASIC PLOAD commands. Both options will use the file specified in the terminal section. The same goes for saving files in run time for the montior S and BASIC PSAVE commands.
