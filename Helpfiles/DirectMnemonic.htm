<h1>Switch mnemonic</h1>
<p>
There are a few 1802 op codes with multiple mnemonics:
<br>33: <B>BDF</B>, BPZ or BGE
<br>38: <B>NBR</B> or SKP
<br>3B: <B>BNF</B>, BM, BL
<br>76: <B>SHRC</B> or RSHR
<br>7E: <B>SHLC</B> or RSHL
<br>C8: <B>NLBR</B> or LSKP
</p>
<p>
All variants will be accepted in the assembler and the variant used will be stored as a type. This can also be changed via the procedure described in chapter <a href="DirectMarking.htm">Changing Address Usage</a> and using marking 'Switch'. If code is executed without a type specified the mnemonics in bold will be used.
</p>
<p>
For example, if type is set to Switch (yellow ellipse) and mark (orange ellipse) is pressed on address hex 4700 in the following example:

the code will change to:

Another mark press on address hex 4700 will change the code to:
