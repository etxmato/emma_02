When using the Cosmac VIP (with VP590 or VP580), RCA Studio II, RCA Studio III / Victory MPT-02 and Visicom COM-100 emulators a second keypad is or can be configured. In this mode a button 'Switch pad' (yellow ellipse) will be available to switch from keypad A to B and back. Note that the 'on Character' button for the VIP keypad B will map all keys to the PC numeric keypad.
