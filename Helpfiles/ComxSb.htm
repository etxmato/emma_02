</p>
<h3>Online</h3>

The online tab shows all settings related to USB commands using online connections, i.e. USB HSWEB, EMAIL and BROWSER.

<p>
Define the Player name and location (highlighted in yellow) as used in the USB HSWEB command. Note that the maximum length of both player name and location is 25 characters and the following characters are not allowed and will be ignored: # ~ ; :.
</p>
<p>
To be able to get your email address specified as sender with USB EMAIL make sure to fill in a
correct and valid email in the &#8216;Email address&#8217; field (highlighted in orange).
</p>
<p>
Home page (highlighted in red) and bookmark (highlighted in blue) fields are used by the USB BROWSER command and can be shown on the COMX by pressing the &#8216;H&#8217; or 0 to 9 keys during a browser session. Max length of these fields is 126 characters. To store a bookmark press the &#8216;Store&#8217; button (highlighted in purple) which will be enabled when typing text in the bookmark text field (highlighted in blue).

Email address and aliases are used by the USB EMAIL command. Any defined alias can be edited
when selected by the Aliases choice button (highlighted in green). A new alias can be defined when NEW as well as &#8216;alias / email address&#8217; (highlighted in brown) is shown.

<p>
Root &#8211; Either use the &#8216;Root&#8217; button (highlighted in yellow) or change the path manually (highlighted in orange) to change the root directory seen from the COMX. The selected root is the highest directory level that can be accessed by the COMX. This is either shown as directory or top-directory on the COMX (depending on &#8216;Show top directory in USB CD&#8217; setting)
</p>
<p>
Show top directory in USB CD &#8211; Select Yes / No (highlighted in red), &#8216;No&#8217; will not show the root directory (PR USB CD will show '/'), &#8216;Yes&#8217; will show the root directory as top-directory (PR USB CD will show 'COMX', assuming the default root folder is used). 
</p>
<p>
Case conversion (highlighted in blue) &#8211; These settings are only used if USB CHAR(0), normal COMX character set or USB CHAR(1), lower case &#8216;default&#8217; standard COMX characters on &#8216;SHIFT&#8217; are selected. USB CHAR(0) is set as default. For these character sets the USB SW will convert any filename or directory name as specified: in lower case, upper case or capitalised. Default all filenames will be in lower case and directory names capitalised. When USB CHAR(2) or (3) are used the capitalisation is as typed on the COMX.
</p>
<p>
Back-up (highlighted in purple) &#8211; Select Yes / No, &#8216;Yes&#8217; will result in creation of a back-up file for the specified commands with the format &#8216;nameNumber.type.bak&#8217;. So when saving a file &#8216;happiehap.comx&#8217; the first back-up file created will be named happiehap1.comx.bak, second happiehap2.comx.bak etc. &#8216;No&#8217; will result in a question on the COMX to overwrite the file Y/N when the file already exist on the PC.
</p>
<h3>ROM files</h3>
<p>
The ROM files tab shows and allows changing of the SB ROM file details, not recommended to be changed.
</p>
<h3>Backup</h3>
<p>
The Backup tab shows all back-up (.bak) files (highlighted in orange) in the specified directory (and if selected sub directories 'yes' highlighted in red). Pressing &#8216;Yes&#8217; (highlighted in blue) will delete all these files.
