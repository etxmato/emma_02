<h2>CDP18S629: 32K RAM/ROM</h2>
<p>

<LI>32 KB RAM or ROM
<LI>Inhibit feature to disable part of the RAM/ROM chips
</UL>
</p>
<p>
To define a system using the CDP18S629 select 'CDP18S629 32K RAM/ROM' from one of the CARD Choice boxes. 
</p>
<p>
To specify the RAM or ROM location, content files  and/or inhibit function press the CARD x button and the CDP18S629 Setup window will open. The CDP18S629 has four RAM or ROM banks in bank sizes of 4 times 8K. Start location can be selected as either 0000 or 8000, i.e. memory runs from 0000-7FFF or 8000-8FFF.
</p>
<p>
Memory inhibit possibilities depend on the start location.
</p>
<p>
Note that the defined RAM or ROM should not overlap with any other defined RAM or ROM in any of the other cards, if this does happen Emma 02 will give a warning (CARD button will turn red and a message will appear in the setup window). Even if warnings are issued the configuration might run in Emma 02 however the board in the highest CARD will override the memory type of lower boards.
