<h2>Pre SW Load</h2>
<p>
To run the Cosmac Vip emulator with SW loaded before the emulator starts select the SW file in the 'RAM SW' field. To change the location use the 'RAM SW' button to browse for the file, do the same to change the filename or type in a new file name in the text field.
</p>
<p>
The selected file will be loaded at RAM address 0 (if the file is binary, other formats like intel hex will be loaded at the specified locations). This can for example be used to start the emulator with the chip-8 interpreter loaded. To also load chip-8 SW directly at address hex 200 (or hex 300 when using Chip-8X) use the 'Chip-8/X/10' button. Default the emulator will start with FPB.
</p>
<p>
Chip-8, Chip-8X and Chip-10 interpreters are stored in the Vip directory and Chip-8 SW is stored in the Chip-8 directory at installation (located in the application data directory, see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>). 
</p>
<p>
When using Chip 10, the check box 'CDP1861 / Chip 10 - High resolution' will need to be cheched, this is done by default if a file called 'chip10.hex' has been selected as RAM SW.
</p>
<p>
The binary, Intel hex and RCS Elf Emulator hex format are supported.

<h3>Super-chip</h3>
<p>
The Super-chip interpreter was designed by me. I started this during the covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Initially for a modified VIP (same HW mod as for the chip10 interpreter) but from the start I planned to port it to the Studio IV. The Studio IV port was actually fairly easy. For more details and explanations for start-up settings see <a href="DebuggerSyntaxSuperchip.htm">Super-chip Syntax</a>.
