<h1>NVR and RTC</h1>
<p>
The DS12887 NVR and RTC are supported, RTC by providing the PC time and date at all times. Both can be switched off by unselecting the DS NVR/RTC check box (yellow ellipse).
</p>
<p>
To clear DS12887 NVR at start-up, select the 'Clear' check box (highlighted in orange). After start-up the emulator will automatically unselect the checkbox.

Note that not all DS12887 features are emulated. Currently the real time clock is loaded with the PC clock values every second and the 15 divider stages will set the PF bit in register C with the specified frequency based directly on the emulated 1802 processor speed.
