<h2>Cassette Support (wave Files)</h2>
<p>
The easiest and fastest way to load or save a .wav file into the Elf (Cosmac Elf, Netronics Elf II or Quest Super Elf) emulator is by making sure both options 'Turbo' and 'Auto' are checked, this should be the default setting when the Emma 02 Emulator is started for the first time. Depending on which type you choose, i.e. automatic or manual please follow the instructions below.  
</p>
<p>
Make sure 'Cassette' is enabled and shown by pressing the 'Toggle: Cassette - XMODEM - Off' button (2 arrows) to toggle between 'Cassette', XMODEM and Off. Cassett support is not enabled by default! The Giant Board configuration which includes a working Cassettes configuration can be loaded via the 'File/Configuration/Load/Giant Board' menu.
</p>
<p>
For specifics on how to use the giant board and super mon also see the chapter on <a href="ElfGiant.htm">Giant Board</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note that we have not been able to load any of the saved wav files on a real Elf. If you have/need that option, please let me know and we can do some trouble shooting on this. Changing the wave file settings might impact the usability of the wav files on a real Elf, see also below.
</p>
<h3>Auto</h3>
<p>
Default settings, to use this make sure 'Auto' is checked.
</p>
<p>
To load a .wav file into the Elf, start the Emma 02 emulator and then the Elf emulator (start button on Elf tab) with ROM supermon.hex or giantboard.hex. Select a .wav file in the Emma 02 window by selecting the 'Cassette' push button. Start the monitor (execute address hex 8000 for the supermon and hex F000 for the giant board). Then press 04-IN, enter the two-byte address of the memory to be loaded and then enter the ending two-byte address (every byte followe by IN). Start the actual load with an additional IN on Elf emulator window and the cassette PLAY button should go green.
</p>
<p>
To save a .wav file from the Elf, Select a .wav file in the Emma 02 window by selecting the 'Cassette' push button. press 03-IN, enter the two-byte address of the memory to be saved and then enter the ending two-byte address (every byte followe by IN). Start the actual save with an additional IN on the Elf emulator window and the cassette REC button should go red. 
</p>
<p>
For both save and load make sure a .wav file is selected in the Emma 02 window before using the save and load instructions otherwise the Elf emulator will hang on the load (until you manually start a .wav file) or with a save the wav sound will not be written to any file.
</p>
<h3>Manual</h3>
<p>
To use this make sure 'Auto' is NOT checked. This setting is more like the cassette handling is on the real Elf however more complicated than Auto.  
</p>
<p>
To load a .wav file into the Elf, start the Emma 02 emulator and then the Elf emulator (start button on Elf tab) with ROM supermon.hex or giantboard.hex. Select a .wav file in the Emma 02 window by selecting the 'Cassette' push button. Start the monitor (execute address hex 8000 for the supermon and hex F000 for the giant board). Then press 04-IN, enter the two-byte address of the memory to be loaded and then enter the ending two-byte address (every byte followe by IN). Now press play and after that as soon as possible press an additional IN on the Elf.
</p>
<p>
To save a .wav file from the Elf, Select a .wav file in the Emma 02 window by selecting the 'Cassette' push button after that press the dark red recording button and press 03-IN, enter the two-byte address of the memory to be saved and then enter the ending two-byte address (every byte followe by IN). Start the actual save with an additional IN on the Elf.
</p>
<h3>Turbo</h3>
<p>
When Turbo is selected the emulator will increase speed when a wav file is played to allow faster LOAD and SAVE possibility in the emulator. The speed of the Turbo can be changed; default is 15 MHz, which works ok on both my desktop and laptop. Too high values will not run ok on slower PCs as all CPU power will be used by the emulator. On my vista desktop vista limits CPU usage to 50% max but on my windows 2000 laptop CPU usage gets up to 100% and can possibly hang the laptop for the duration of the LOAD or SAVE command.
</p>
<h3>Wave File Settings</h3>
<p>
Via the 'Settings' drop down menu select 'Wav File and Real Cassette Settings' to change the wave file settings used for saving or loading a '.wav' file. . The following subchapters describe applicable settings in more detail. Settings for saving to a file are the 'Wave volume', 'Bit Rate' and 'Bits per sample', setting for loading a wav file are the 'Wav file conversion' and 'Reversed Polarity'. The 'Cassette conversion' and 'Input Channel' are only used for Real Cassette loading.
</p>
<h4>Wave volume</h4>
<p>
1 to 15 (where 15 is the loudest)
</p>
<h4>Bit Rate</h4> 
<p>
11025, 22050, 44100 or 88200 (samples per second)
</p>
<h4>Bits per sample</h4>
<p>
8 or 16
</p>
<h4>Wav file conversion</h4> 
<p>
Two conversion types can be used:<br>
1. <B>Amplitude</B>: where the signal is converted to a 1 on positive amplitude and a 0 on a negative amplitude.<br>
2. <B>Sinus</B>: where the signal is converted to a 1 on an upward sinus and a 0 on a downward sinus
</p>
<p>
Default this is set to 'Amplitude' which works for all my wav files. Depending on the emulated computer this might need to be changed if loading does not work or gives tape errors.
</p>
<h4>Reversed Polarity</h4> 
<p>
Switch converted signal polarity (1->0 and 0->1) as described for conversion types above.
