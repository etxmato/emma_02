<h1>When I select the 32K RAM card the COMX still states 30K at PR MEM</h1>
<p>
This is correct behaviour, the original 32K RAM card was never supported from BASIC. The extra memory can be used via machine code and/or expansion card commands; see also the <a href="ComxRamCard.htm">32K RAM</a> and <a href="ComxExpansion.htm">expansion box</a> help chapters for some additional details.
