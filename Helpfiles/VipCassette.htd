<h1>Cassette Support</h1>
<p>
The common functionality for cassette handling is described in the section <a href="ComputerCassette.htm">Cassette Support</a>. For details on how to use a real cassette player connected to a PC and Emma 02 please see the section: <a href="ComputerRealCassette.htm">Real Cassette Support</a>.
</p>
<p>
The following sub section describe Cosmac VIP specific cassette handling for both automatic and manual options.
</p>
<p>
This section describes the LOAD and SAVE handling in ROM mode, for FPB mode handling see the Cosmac VIP II section: <a href="VipIICassette.htm">Cassette Support</a>
</p>
<h2>Auto LOAD/SAVE</h2>
<p>
To use this option 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' should be checked (highlighted in yellow) which is the default setting:
</p>

<p>
To load a .wav file into the Cosmac Vip, start the system rom (C + twice F12) and type the start address (e.g. 0000). Then press 'B' and the number of 'blocks of 256 bytes' you want to load (1 to F) on the Cosmac VIP emulator window and the cassette play button (highlighted in green) will go green.
</p>
<p>
To save a .wav file from the Cosmac Vip, start the system rom (C + twice F12) and type the start address (e.g. 0000). Press 'F' and the number of 'blocks of 256 bytes' you want to save (1 to F) on the Cosmac VIP emulator window and the cassette record button(highlighted in red) will go red. 
</p>
<p>
For both save and load make sure a .wav file is selected in the Emma 02 window before using the save and load instructions otherwise the Cosmac Vip emulator will hang on the load (until you manually start a .wav file) or with a save the wav sound will not be written to any file.
</p>
<h2>Manual LOAD/SAVE</h2>
<p>
To use this option 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' should NOT be checked. This setting is more like the cassette handling is on the real Cosmac VIP however a bit more complicated than Auto LOAD/SAVE:

</p>
<p>
To save a .wav file from the Cosmac Vip, start the system rom (C + twice F12) and type the start address (e.g. 0000).  Then Press the dark red record button (highlighted in red) and press 'F' and the number of 'blocks of 256 bytes' you want to save (1 to F) on the Cosmac Vip.
</p>
<p>
Saving or loading can be stopped at anytime by pressing the stop button (highlighted in brown). When stopping a load while the Cosmac VIP is in loading mode will however hang the Cosmac VIP.
