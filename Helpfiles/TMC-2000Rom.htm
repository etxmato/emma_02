<h2>ROM Files</h2>
<p>
To run the Telmac 1800 or 2000 emulator at least the system ROM file should be specified in the 'ROM' field. Default Telmac ROM location is the TMC1800 or TMC2000 directory (located in the application data directory, see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>) and the default filename is 'telmac2000.rom' or 'telmac1800.rom' (depending on computer selected). To change the location use the 'ROM' button to browse for the file, do the same to change the filename or type in a new file name in the text field.
</p>
<p>
The binary, Intel hex and RCS Elf Emulator hex format are supported.
