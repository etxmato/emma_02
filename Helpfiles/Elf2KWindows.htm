<h2>Control Windows</h2>
<p>
3 types of Elf 2000 control windows can be emulated. The main board (highlighted in yellow), switch panel (highlighted in orange) and hex panel (highlighted in blue). Note the switch and hex panel can not be emulated simultaneously.

The main board includes the status LEDs and TIL311 displays. Emulation of the TIL311 displays and the LEDs can take a lot of PC CPU power so default these are only updated every 100 ms. This can be changed in the Emma 02 window by changing the 'LEDs' field (highlighted in green). When 0 ms (or nothing) is specified the TIL311 displays and LEDs will be updated in real time. Note that the SC0 and SC1 LEDs are not emulated also due to PC CPU power needs.
