<h1>Video Terminal Simulation</h1>
<p>
3 video terminal options are available:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vt100.net/dec/ek-vt5x-op-001.pdf">VT52</a>: for a DEC VT52 video terminal simulation
<li><a href="https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/">VT100</a>: for a DEC VT100 video terminal simulation
<li>External: for using an external windows or linux software terminal
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Note the DEC terminals are simulators, i.e. all functionality is simulated and NOT running the original terminal software. Both terminals support all ESC sequences and full functionality (except for self test features and keyboard LEDs), however as I don't have software supporting everything and also don't have an actual terminal not all functionality has been tested.
