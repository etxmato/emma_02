<h2>Screen Dump</h2>
<p>
To write the screen output to a file press F5 or the 'File Save' button (only possible when one of the emulators is running). Default the file name 'screendump.x.png' (Portable Network Graphics Image) will be used where 'x' will count up from '1' for every new screen dump.
</p>
<p>
Type a different name in the filename field to change the output file name. To change the directory location of the output file (and/or also the file name) use the VideoDump button and select another directory and/or file.
</p>
<p>
Default the file will be stored in the emulator directory (located in the application data directory, see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>).
</p>
<p>
To save a file of a different type than a portable network graphics image, change the extension to the desired type, the following types are supported:  png (Portable Network Graphics Image), jpeg (JPEG Image), bmp (Bitmap Image) and pcx (Paintbrush Image).
