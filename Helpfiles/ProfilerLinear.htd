<h1>Linear & Logarithmic Counters</h1>
<p>
Two different type of execution counters are supported, linear and logarithmic. This can be switched with the 'Type' selector (highlighted in green) resulting in one of the following:
</p>
<p>
Linear:<br>

Linear counters count up 1 for every time that specific instruction is executed; from 1 to max 18.446.744.073.709.551.615 (i.e. a 64 bit unsigned integer). When the max value is reached the counter will stop on the max value.
</p>
<p>
Logarithmic:<br>

Logarithmic counters use the formula 5*ln(number of executions), resulting in a range of 1 to max 221. The same counter value is used to set the colour of the instruction.</p>
