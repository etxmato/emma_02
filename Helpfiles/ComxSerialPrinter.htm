<h1>Serial Printer Support</h1>
<p>
To run the COMX emulator with the Serial printer card select rs232.bin in any available slot (CARD 1 if no expansion box is used), see example below (yellow ellipse):

<p>
For details on configuring other printer types, see <a href="ComxPrinter.htm">Parallel Printer Support</a>, <a href="ComxThermal.htm">Thermal Printer Support</a> and <a href="ComxPlotter.htm">PL-80 Plotter Simulation</a>. 
</p>
<h2>Printing to File</h2>
<p>
To print to a file select 'File' in the selection box next to the printer output file name (orange ellipse). When a 'printer on' command is send with a CARD P3 (if an <a href="ComxExpansion.htm">expansion box</a> is configured) or a CALL (@C070) a printout file is created (as specified in the orange ellipse). If the indicated print file already exists a new file is created with the next sequence number. E.g. if the print file is 'printerout.txt', this file is used the first time, after a CARD P1 (printer off) and a CARD P3 (printer on) the file printerout.1.txt' will be created.
</p>
<h3>Printing to Screen and or Printer</h3>
<p>
To print to an output screen and/or to a real printer, first select 'STD' (orange ellipse):
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
After this send a 'printer on' command from the COMX or open the printer output screen manually. A 'printer on' command from the COMX can be done with a CARD P3 (if an <a href="ComxExpansion.htm">expansion box</a> is configured) or a CALL (@C070). To open the output screen manually, press the F4 button or the printer icon (blue ellipse) before giving printer commands from the COMX.
</p>

</p>
<p>
When the printer output screen opens, the print, preview and setup buttons will be disabled. When the COMX is ready with the printout and a CARD P1 or CALL (@C050) is given these buttons will be enabled (yellow ellipse). After this it is possible to use the print button to send the printout to a real printer, use preview and/or change printer settings. 
</p>
<p>
To start a new printout close the printer output screen. After this a new printer window will be created when the COMX starts the first output to the printer.
</p>
<p>
The printer font can be changed with the second 'Font' choice buttons (blue ellipse). Default the teletype font is used which has a fixed width per line (like a matrix printer), all other fonts have a variable character width. The number of characters per line can be changed (40, 80, 96 or 120) with the first 'Font' choice button (orange ellipse). 
</p>
<p>
It is possible to disable the COMX status LEDs by clicking one of the LEDs, a red cross shows the LEDs are disabled (yellow ellipse). This will speed up printout especially when using higher CPU speeds.

<h2>Serial Printer CALL and CARD Routines</h2>
<p>
The printer can be activated by using the CARD Pm commands as described below and in the <a href="ComxExpansion.htm">Expansion Box</a> chapter. If no expansion box is used the same commands can be activated by CALL statements:
</p>

<p>
Note: if the expansion box is used the user should enable the standard printer card first before any assembly call is initiated. This can be done by the OUT 1 instruction or in BASIC by using any CARD Pm statement before the CALL statement.
