<h2>ROM Files</h2>
<p>
To run the COMX emulator at least the COMX basic ROM file should be specified in the 'ROM' field (orange ellipse). Default COMX ROM location is the Comx directory (located in the application data directory, see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>) and the default filename is 'sb.0000.bin' which is part of the Super Board configuration. To change the ROM file see details in chapter <a href="ComxSb.htm">Super Board</a>.

To change the location in this configuration use the 'ROM' button (yellow ellipse) to browse for the file, do the same to change the filename or type in a new file name in the text field (orange ellipse):
