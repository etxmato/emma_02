<h2>ROM Files</h2>
<p>
To run the Pecom 32 or 64 emulator at least the Pecom system ROM file should be specified in the 'ROM' field. Default Pecom ROM location is the Pecom directory (located in the application data directory, see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>) and the default filename is 'pecom64.v4' which is already filled in. Two other ROM files are available 'pecom32.bin' select this to emulate the Pecom 32 and an older Pecom 64 rom: 'pecom64.v1'. To change the location use the 'ROM' button to browse for the file, do the same to change the filename or type in a new file name in the text field. 
</p>
<p>
The binary, Intel hex and RCS Elf Emulator hex format are supported. Also MESS multiple ROM files are supported; to use this just select one of the ROM files.
