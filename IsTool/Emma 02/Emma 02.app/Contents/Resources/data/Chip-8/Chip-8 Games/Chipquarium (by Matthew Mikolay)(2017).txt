CHIPQUARIUM: A CHIP-8 fish tank simulator.

Your mission is to keep your pet fish alive as long as possible. To do so, you will need to:

    Make sure the tank is kept clean.
    Make sure your fish never too hungry.
    Make sure your fish is happy.

If your fish is healthy and happy enough, he will eventually grow larger. But be sure your fish 
gets enough sleep! He will refuse to eat and play if he is too tired.

Controls (Cosmac VIP):
----------------------
Press the F key to feed your fish.

Press the C key to clean the tank.

Press the D key to have your fish sleep.

Press the B key to play rock-paper-scissors with your fish.

Press the E key to view your fish's stats.

During the rock-paper-scissors minigame:

Press the 2 key to cycle up through the options.

Press the 8 key to cycle down through the options.
Notes

In its current form, the game is playable, but I'll likely make some improvements in the future. 
I think the stats engine and minigame could use some more work, and I also plan on adding an 
ending screen.

Chipquarium was written using the original CHIP-8 instruction set. As a result, it should run 
on the COSMAC VIP without any issues.
