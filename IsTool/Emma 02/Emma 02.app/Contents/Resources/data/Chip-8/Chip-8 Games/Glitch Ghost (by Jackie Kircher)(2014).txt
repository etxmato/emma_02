glitch ghost is all alone in the cemetery, please help them make some friends by turning the 
trespassing humans into new ghosts!

Controls:
---------
6 (E) - advance the title screen

6 (E) - haunt! if there is a person on the screen then they will run away from you. you can move 
    while the person is running

5,7,8,9 (WASD) - move up, left, down, and right respectively

Goal:
-----
each screen of the cemetery has a unique layout of tombstones. you'll need to figure out how to 
get each person to run into their own graves. once scared, each person will run away from glitch 
ghost and turn right whenever they encounter an obstacle, be it a grave, the fence, or even glitch 
ghost themselves. only one person will enter the cemetery at a time, and they'll always come in 
through the front gate.
