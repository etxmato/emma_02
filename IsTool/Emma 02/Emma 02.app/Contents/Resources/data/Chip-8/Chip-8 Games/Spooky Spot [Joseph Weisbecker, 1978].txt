Spooky Spot, by: Joseph Weisbecker

Now you can let the computer make your big decisions or predict the future just like governmentt or industry leaders do. 
You will see the words YES and NO at the right of the screen. Ask the computer any question that can be answered with YES or NO. Press KEY 0 and the spooky spot will show you the computer's answer. This program replaces your old fashioned mechanical OUIJA board.
