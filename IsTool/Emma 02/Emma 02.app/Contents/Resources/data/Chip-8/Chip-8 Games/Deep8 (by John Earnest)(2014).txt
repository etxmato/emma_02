------------------------------

A stripped down port of the Mako game "Deep" for Chip8. Move your boat 
left and right with A/D. Press S to drop a bomb and release S to detonate 
it. Destroy incoming squid before they tip your boat!

This game was one of the earliest programs written using Octo.
