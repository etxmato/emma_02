Here's how to play UFO:

You have a stationary missle launcher at the bottom of the screen. You
can shoot in three directions; left diagonal, straight up, and right
diagonal.. using the keys 4, 5, and 6 respectively.. You try to hit
one of two objects flying by.. at apparently varying speeds..  Your
score is displayed on your left, the number of missles you have left
is displayed on your right. (You get 15)..

This game ("UFO") is not new.  I have a copy of it from 1977 (!).  It
was one of the original CHIP-8 games on the audio cassette that was
included when I bought my first computer, the Finnish-made Telmac
1800.

It was also the first real program to run under CHIP-48 (it was used
as a test case during the development of the CHIP-48 interpreter). The
reason I have not posted it to the net myself is that I have no idea
about its copyright status.  I don't even know where it originated
(RCA, perhaps?).

The cassette that was bundled with the Telmac 1800 contains more than
a dozen CHIP-8 programs.  If someone could convince me that these
programs are indeed freely redistributable, the other programs could
also be posted.  Otherwise, perhaps this one shouldn't have been.
