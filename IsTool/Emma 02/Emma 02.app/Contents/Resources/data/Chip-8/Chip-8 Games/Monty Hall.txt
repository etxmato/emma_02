Use the number "1", "2" or "3" to choose an initial door. When asked if you want to switch, enter 
a number again.

In the upper right corner, the first number is the number of wins, and the second number is the 
total number of tries.

In short, it is always better to switch doors once a door is opened for you. Information on why 
can be found on the web: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem

I thought it would be interesting to experience this first-hand. And I swear, I'm not messing with 
the random numbers! :)
