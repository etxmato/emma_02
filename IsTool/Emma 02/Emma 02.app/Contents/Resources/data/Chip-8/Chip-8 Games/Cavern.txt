Hello all!

I recently finished a new game implemented in CHIP8. It's called Cavern, and is conceptually based 
upon the CHIP8 game Cave.

Cavern allows the player to select one of three speeds for gameplay, though the easiest setting is 
still pretty challenging. I suppose Cavern could be considered a game suitable for individuals who 
found Cave too easy.

The in-game controls are 2, 4, 6, and 8 to move the sprite on screen.

I've attached the .ch8 file for anyone interested in playing. It has been tested on the Emma emulator. 
If anybody comes across any bugs, please let me know!

Best,
Matt
