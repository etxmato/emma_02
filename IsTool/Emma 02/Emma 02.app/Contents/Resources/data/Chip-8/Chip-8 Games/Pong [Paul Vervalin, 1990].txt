OK. here is PONG version 1.1.  The ball is a little faster in this
version making play a little more realistic.  I know PONG 1.0 was
just posted yesterday, but I think this version is significantly
better, so here it is.

Use keys 7 and 4 move left player and / and * move right player.

Enjoy!!
