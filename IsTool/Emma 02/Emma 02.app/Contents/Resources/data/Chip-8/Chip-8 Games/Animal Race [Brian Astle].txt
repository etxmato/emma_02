Hints for expert players
All animals move at approximately the same speed, but they start from different
positions.  The odds for each animal are related to the starting position but
include a random element.  Some races favor the player and you should bet up to
the limit on these.  Some races are unfavorable and you should bet carefully
on these.

You can win the game by accumulating $256 or more.
