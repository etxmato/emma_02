                               TETRIS
                          by Fran Dachille

This is my first release of the famous Tetris game on the HP48S. I was
inspired by the lack enjoyable games for our favorite handheld.  [Not since the
Goodies Disks have been available!  -jkh-]  This game, though it lacks some of
the whistles and bangs of fancy versions, performs on par with quality arcade
versions (nota bene -> SPEED).  At my college, every person who picks up my
calculator is immediately hooked for hours.

This version is written for the CHIP48 game interpreter (c)
copyright 1990 Andreas Gustafsson.  

The 4 key is left rotate, 5 - left move, 6 - right move, 1
- drop, ENTER - restart, DROP - end.  After every 5 lines, the speed
increases slightly and peaks at 45 lines.

There is room for improvement in this version.  Notably, background
pictures, a pause key (for now, hold ON), two rotate keys, various
starting skill levels, a B version which starts with randomn blocks,
finishing graphics, and high scores, just to name a few.

In order for improvements, I need to know if there is reasonable
demand.  If this game is worth playing for hours upon hours, please let
me know.  If you wish to support the improvements, want future versions,
and want to see other games ported to the HP48S, send $5.00 to:
