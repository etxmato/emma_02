Rush Hour (v1.1) for CHIP-8 by hap 08-02-08, http://hap.samor.nl/
Originally released on 17-12-06. Version 1.1 improves a few things.
Based on a boardgame by Nobuyuki Yoshigahara "Nob" and ThinkFun,
http://www.thinkfun.com/

This game contains 170 puzzles. Most were taken from the original cardsets,
some were made by me, and some were generated with Michel's PyTraffic,
http://alpha.uhasselt.be/Research/Algebra/Members/pytraffic . Refer to
the source code for detailed information on this.

HOW TO PLAY
===========

The goal of the game is to slide the arrow block(s) out of the 6*6 grid.
Completing 10 boards will be awarded with the inclusion of the next boardset(s)
as seen from the connections on the boardset select screen, a password will be
given so you don't have to complete the game in a single session.
