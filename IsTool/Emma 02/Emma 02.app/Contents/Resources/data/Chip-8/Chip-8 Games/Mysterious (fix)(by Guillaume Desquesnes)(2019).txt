Fix done by Marcel van Tongeren: On the VIP numbers were not shown at all. I added number graphics 0 to 9 @322-352 and changed the LD I,000 @250 & @26A to LD I,322

---------------------------------------

Once "GUESS" appears on screen, press "F" on the hexpad to start and then,
enter two digits from 0 to 9 to guess the number between 00 and 99 that
the program has randomly picked. 

If you enter (as an example) "25", the program then will tell you either
to guess beneath "25" by showing an arrow pointing in the left direction
or an arrow pointing to the right to guess higher than "25".

Once you guessed the number, you will hear a tone for one second. :)
