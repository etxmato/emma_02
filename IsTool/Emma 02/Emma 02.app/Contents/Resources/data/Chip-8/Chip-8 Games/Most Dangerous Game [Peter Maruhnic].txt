10. VIP Most Dangerous Game

VIP Most Dangerous Game pits a hunter against a hunted in a maze.  The hunter must
shoot the hunted before either time runs out or the hunted escapes the maze.
However, neither the hunted nor the hunter can see a wall in the maze until he runs
into it.  There is always at least one path through the maze.

How To Play VIP Most Dangerous Game

1. Load the CHIP-8 interpretor at 0000-01FF
   and the game starting at 0200.

2. Turn RUN switch on.

3. Hunted's turn:
   When the arrow appears in the lower left, it is the hunted's turn.  Keys 2-4-6-8
   control direction (up-left-right-down, respectively).  The hunted continues to
   move until a) he makes 5 moves, b) he hits a wall or c) key 0 is pressed.

4. Hunter's turn
   When the arrow appears in the lower right, it is the hunter's turn.  The hunter's
   turn consists of two modes, the move and the shoot.  Keys 2-4-6-8 and 0 control both
   modes.  Like the hunted, the hunter continues to move until a) he makes 3 moves,
   b) he hits a wall or c) key 0 is pressed.  If he hits the wall, case b), he cannot
   fire a bullet.  The hunter may fire one of his bullets using the direction keys
   2-4-6-8.  The bullet will travel four squares in the corresponding direction, unless
   a wall is encountered.  If the hunter prefers not to use a bullet, he must press key 0.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until:
   a) The number of turns (upper left on the display) expire.  The hunted wins.
   b) The hunter lands on or shoots the hunted.  The hunter wins.
   c) The hunted lands on hunter, thereby giving up.  The hunter wins.
   d) The hunted reaches the lower right corner of the maze with at least 1 move
      remaining in his turn.  The hunted wins, by escaping the maze.
