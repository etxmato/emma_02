1337,

What the hack is going on?! Where have you been?! HQ are really mad at you.
By the way we have lost a contact with our last operational resource on foreign
soil. Our SAR team is waiting for a green light to launch a MEDEVAC operation.
But we have no clue where he is.

This is your task.

You have to track the place of his residence. This is CHIP-8 ROM image that the
handler was given during last contact meeting.

Remember, failure is not an option. We don't want international scandal and SOFs
involved.

Good luck!

Over and out.

P.S. Burn after read.
P.S.2. I'll show/explain the solution in a video in one or two weeks.
P.S.3. This mission was brought to you by foxtrot_charlie!
P.S.4. In the final phase use a string, not a number. Try different offsets.
P.S.5. The above remark is pretty cryptic... :)
