This isn't a game, rather it is an implementation of 1D Cellular Automata because those are cool.

This version is 150 bytes even, and loops through and shows the first 28 (or so) steps of various rules for 1D CAs. I start at rule 20, just because that's where it starts to get interesting.

This is, in reality, pretty slow - the version as you see it is running at 1000 cycles/second. I think I could write a faster one with a tradeoff in program size.

For bragging rights: if I don't include the rule number drawing then it goes down to 115 bytes!
