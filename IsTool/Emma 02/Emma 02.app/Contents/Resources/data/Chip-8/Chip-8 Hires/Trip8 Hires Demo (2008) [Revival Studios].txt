Description:
------------
The Trip8/SuperTrip8 demo are demo's for the Chip-8, Chip-8 Hires and SuperChip8 systems. The demo consists of an intro, 3D vectorballs, and 4 randomized dot-effects.  

Writing a demo for the original Chip-8 interpreter was a real pain, since your framerate basically drops in half for every sprite you need to draw. So even clearing and redrawing a few dots will cause the framerate to drop to near zero :) Originally the demo was going to be bigger and there were much more graphical effects programmed/prototyped, but a lot of these effects turned out to be too much for the original unoptimized Chip-8 interpreters to handle. 
The 64x64 Hires version of the demo will also work on the original hardware without modification.

Running the Demo:
-----------------
Use the Megachip emulator or any other Chip-8/SuperChip compatible emulator to run the demo.
