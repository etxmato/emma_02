Hey guys!

Here's another little program I wrote to test out a feature in my game. This
program allows the user to change the value of the V3 register using the 2 and 8
keys. When the 5 key is pressed, the delay timer starts counting down from the
value the user placed into the V3 register, and the screen is updated as the
value changes.
