Clock_better for Chip-8

Why:
* My first Chip-8 program
* It waits for key-up when setting the clock, so it can be used with interpreters like Vision8, as well as old hardware (I don't have any old hardware to test it with, so I am supposing here).
* Checks for input range, i.e. hours are 00-23, minutes are 00-59, and seconds are 00-59

Uses Chip-8 features:
* Delay timer DT.  It should keep accurate time on interpreters where DT actually counts down at 60 per second and instructions per second are not tied to DT.
* Sound - beep for pressing non-decimal, or numbers out of range for a clock

How it could be better:
* Prettier font
* Alarm
* Smaller?  Don't even try this one if you have to key it in with a hex keypad.

Problems I encountered while writing this:
* There are no instructions for storing or retrieving the index register I.
* There are no instructions for directly storing a register to memory, nor directly loading from memory.  These are all indirect through I.
* There is only one index register I
