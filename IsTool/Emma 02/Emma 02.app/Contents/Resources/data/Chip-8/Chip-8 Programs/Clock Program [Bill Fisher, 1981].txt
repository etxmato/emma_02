This neat little clock program is the perfect program to run when someone asks: 
"That's nice, but what can your computer DO?"
The program features "reverse" video numerals on the screen, which is a nice change from the
usual white numbers on a black background.

Instructions:
- Type six digits on the hex keypad for the desired clock starting time, using 23 hour format (ex.173055)
- Hit any hex key to start clock running at the above time setting.
