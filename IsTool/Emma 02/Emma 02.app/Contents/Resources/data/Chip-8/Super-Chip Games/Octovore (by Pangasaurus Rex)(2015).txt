a game of hungry hungry octopods

play as a starving octopus who just has to eat everything in sight, from crumbs to fishies to donuts. you control its ever-extending arms as it frenzies for food.

you must collect every piece of food to advance to the next level. can you beat all 9?

for an extra challenge, try raising the clock speed above the default 120 cycles/frame ;)
