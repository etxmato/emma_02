Hello out there

Somehow I didn't manage to find a good Tetris for my HP48GX yet so I wrote one
myself. It is a S-CHIP48 Program. I think it is quite good, at least very fast
and full screen!!!
Every 15 lines a new level starts with more lines at the bottom.


The Keys:
    7   - left
    5   - turn
    1   - right
    4   - drop
    3   - begin pause
    9   - stop pause
