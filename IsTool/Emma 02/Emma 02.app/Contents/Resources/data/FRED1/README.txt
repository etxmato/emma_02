Acey Duecy.bin
==============

Two playing card values appear in the upper left corner. $25 appears in the upper right corner. This is the money you have. The flashing question marks mean that the computer is waiting for you to place your bet. You will bet that the value of the next card dealt by the computer lies between the two card values shown (not equal to either). Bet by pressing any keyboard positions (2 = 2$, 8 = $8, A = $10, F = $15). You can bet a maximum of $15 (press F) and a minimum of $1 (press 1). You can' bet more than you have. You have to get $100 to break the bank. New game = reset/run.

Add Drill.bin
=============

This SW needs spoken text and tones recorded on original tape and included in Add Drill.wav. Start card will be requested which card '0' (code 0xFE). Press the start card 2 times and after the tone a 3rd time. Then type the sum of the 'add' question when one pops up.

Animate demo.bin
================

Demo which loads data from tape and displays that data on the screen. Data is included in 'Animate demo data.bin' file but is not loadable as such in Emma 02.

Binary.bin
==========

On startup press 3, 4, 5 or 6 for the number of bits. Then the computer will show a binary figure, convert this to decimal and type the answer. If correct it gets counted on the 'Y' line if wrong it is counted on the 'N' line. If wrong you will need to try again.

Bowling.bin
===========
 
Two players, X & O. 5 Frames, 2 balls/frame. Enter any number to roll ball. F1, F2 etc. indicates frame number. X1, X2, O1, O2 indicates player and ball number. New game = reset/run.

This game used sounds on tape when a ball is rolled, the sounds on the tape were recordings from a bowling ball hitting targets; repeated multiple times. The file included here is 'Bowling.wav' which includes the rolling ball once. This file can be used in Emma 02 as Emma 02 will restart the tape after every 'play' which means it is synced better than when using the file with the repeated sounds.

Calculate.bin
=============

Use 0 to 9 for numbers, A=sign, B='.' and D=CLR
Shift: 1=(, 2=X, 3=), 4=-, 5=Result, 6=/, 7=<-, 8=->, 0=+

==========

The computer will choose a 4 digit random number which you must guess within 15 turns to win. No two digits in the number are the same. Enter your first guess by pressing 4 keyboard digits. The computer then provides some clues. 0 2 means 2 of the digits you entered match two digits of the unknown number but are not in the correct position. 0 means none of your digits are in the correct position. 2 1 means you have 2 digits right and in the proper position and 1 digit right but in the wrong position. Can you develop a strategy for always guessing the number within 15 tries? New game = reset/run.

Luckypath.bin
=============

Press two byte codes, every code will make a random path, when the path connects from left to right you win.

Match I.bin
===========

This game is for two players (1 and 2). The object is to find matching pairs of symbols. Press card '0' to start the game (or FF in BYTE mode). A 4 x 4 array of symbols will flash on the screen. The 16 keyboard positions represent symbol positions on the screen. Player 1 presses two keyboard positions trying to find two matching symbols. If he finds two that match, they are replaced by 1 on the screen. He then gets another turn. If he doesn't find two matching symbols it is player 2's turn next. Turns alternate in this fashion until all symbols have been matched. Players always get extra turns for finding matching symbols. Count 1's and 2's showing to determine winner of game. New game = reset/run.

Match II.bin
============

Same game as Match.bin with different cards. To start press '0' instead of 'FF'

Move spot to symbols, press 'A' to lock a symbol and move it with the keys, some directions don't work. 'C' drops the symbol and you can move to another. 'F' is fight adjacent symbol from other player.

What the aim of the game is I don't know, maybe this is some strategic game?

Nimnet.bin
==========

Similar to Lukcypath, uses cards with hex codes A1/A2, B1-B4, C1-C5, D1-D5, E1-E4 and F1/F2. I think the cards were not marked and with luck you had to create a path from the left 'dot' to the right 'dot' using random cards.
