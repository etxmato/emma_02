Studio III test cartridge. The code should run from address 0. At start-up it will wait for a key press: on '1' memory compare will be executed for 0x400-0x7FF with 0x2400-0x27FF, on '0' or '2' to '9' also a compare will be done for 0xC00-0xFFF with 0x2C00-0x2FFF. If any error is found 'BAD' will be shown, otherwise 1 or 2 depending on first key press. Either way memory compare will restart from the beginning.

If at start of memory test the same key on controller B is kept pressed only a memory compare for 0x400-0x5FF will be executed.
