PATCHES Bill Kreykes, St Albans, Vic. 

For this game, you will need your ETI-660 with colour and full memory complement. The program draws 100 patches' on the screen in a series of columns. Beneath the field of patches is your ship which runs left and right along a coloured line. 

The colour of the patches changes constantly at random, except when you fire a missile, at which time the pattern freezes until your missile hits something. 

Your ship and colour line change colour every two to four seconds, depending on how much fuel is wasted. You waste fuel if your ship remains stationary, a missile fails to strike a patch when fired, or if you strike a patch with a colour not corresponding to the colour of your ship. The object is to have your missile strike a patch the same colour as your ship. You score points according to the colour of the patch strucfc Jhe patch explodes' when you score a valid strike. Points are deducted if you hit a patch of a colour different to your ship. That patch then goes red. Patches are 

worth the following number of points: 

BLACK 000 
RED 100 
BLUE 200 
VIOLET 300 
GREEN 400 
YELLOW 500 
PALE BLUE 600 
WHITE 700 

There are two special patches hidden in the field: one bonus patch and one dud patch, each game. They are worth 10 times the score of the corresponding colour â€” added to your score for the bonus patch, deducted for the dud patch! You never know where these special patches are until you hit them! As the colour of these special patches changes constantly, too. the special points added to or deducted from your score can vary between 1000 and 7000. 

Your score is displayed in the centre of the screen above the field of patches. You commence with 0000 When you hit a bonus patch, the number of bonus points is displayed at top left. When you hit a dud patch, the points deducted are shown at top right.
