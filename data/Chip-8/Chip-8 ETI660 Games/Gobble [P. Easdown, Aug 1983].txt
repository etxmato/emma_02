GOBBLE 

Peter Easdown, Kew NSW 

Gobble 660 is a game similar to Pacman. The basic aim of the game is to avoid the enemy and 
to eat as many of the pills as possible. The maze is quite different but is complex enough to make a good game. 

Here are a few of its features: 

1. The enemy moves at the same speed as you but can catch you easily if you have trouble getting around corners, or if it takes short cuts. 

2. There is only one enemy as more would only slow the game down; also 3K isn’t enough memory for more than one enemy. 

3. The enemy can get stuck if you outsmart them; this will allow you to get more points without the threat of being caught. 

4. The game has two tunes in it to make it more professional. These tunes are appropriate to the
different stages of play. 

5. The program incorporates the ‘five digit scoring’ routine at locations 06BO — 0726. This routine has previously been published in the January 1983 issue of ETI. 

6. It also incorporates part of the Character Generator which was published in the March 1983 issue of ETI. 

7. The speed of the game is quite good considering the amount of work done for the enemy between moves. 

If you wish to change the values for the keys used for directing your gobbler around the screen then change the values at: 

0912 — up 
0918 — down 
091E — left 
0924 — right 

This program will not work on any other computer as it uses all of the 660’s screen. 

With the program in as listed use the following keys: 

Key Direction 
0 up 
1 down 
2 left 
3 right 

The score is shown at the top of the screen and the amount of gobblers left is shown below
the maze. There are 2350 points for every full board. 

Happy gobbling.
