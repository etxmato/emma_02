NOUGHTS & CROSSES- 

David Pye, Happy Valley SA. 

This program is a game of noughts and crosses for two players, but with a slight difference. 

Upon running the program, the standard field’ for noughts and crosses is drawn on the screen with O PLAYS' underneath. 

Pressing a key from 1 to 9 puts a O' in the corresponding square. The O PLAYS’’ then changes to "X PLAYS’’ and the X player can then press any key from 1 to 9 to put his X in whichever square he wants it. (But not on top of the existing 0 — the same goes when O plays.) Play then reverts to “O PLAYS". 

If you fill all nine squares without either player getting three in a row. the words END GAME PUSH KEY will appear above PLAYS". Pressing any key then resets the 660 and a new game can commence. 

If a player gets three in a row, pressing key F will reset the computer to start a new game. 

Now here comes the twist. If, during a game a player takes too long to press a key (about 15 seconds or so), the message TOO LATE!!!" appears above PLAYS" and a decreasing tone sounds. The message “TOO LATE" is then replaced by “END GAME PUSH KEY" and O PLAYS' or “X PLAYS" is replaced by O WINS or X WINS ' as appropriate. 

The time cutoff for making a move makes the game more interesting and the delay is not constant as you'd expect! 

The program is structured as follows: 

0602-0618: display field (data at 0700-0716) 
0620: call 'display O' routine 
0622: call 'display PLAYS' routine 
0628-065C: key calls for 0; keys 1 to 9 
065E-0668: go to start if 0 misses turn 
0670-0672: swap X for 0 before PLAYS 
0674-0676: end game 
067A-06AE: key calls for X; keys 1 to 9 
06B0-06BA: go to start if X misses turn 
06BC-06CA: data for PLAYS 
06D0-06D2: swap X for 0 before PLAYS 
06D0-06E8: data for 'TOO LATE !!!' 
06EA-06F8: display routines for 0 and X 
06FA-06FE: data for X 
0700-0716: field data 
071C-0722: display 0 at 1 st square of field 
0726-0778: and so on for all squares of field 
0786-078E: spare memory 
0790-07D8: display X at squares 1 to 9 
07DE-07F8: routine to display 'TOO LATE !!!"
