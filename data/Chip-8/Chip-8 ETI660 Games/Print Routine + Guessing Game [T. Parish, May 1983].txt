PRINT ROUTINE 

This subroutine provides an easy way of coding a number of multi-line messages for printing on the screen during execution of a CHIP 8 program on the '660. It features: *13 characters per line • long messages flow onto new lines as required • equal spacing between characters of different width (making more natural-looking words). 

The memory requirement in any program calling the subroutine is just seven bytes per message plus one byte per character — that’s pretty economical. 

The routine occupies the last 1 /3K of a 3K machine, equivalent in memory requirement to about 58 characters, and is most useful in message oriented games (such as Guessing Game’, reproduced here). 

The subroutine leaves all registers unchanged, except VO and VI. Here's an example of how to use the subroutine: 

Call: (prints HELLO) 
0720 A831 points to start of message 
0722 A720 points to above instruction 
0724 2EA8 call PRINT 

Data: 
0830 0506 length of message/'H 
0832 0408 ‘E’/‘L’ 
0834 0809 ‘L’/’O’

There are two approaches to using PRINT with various programs: (1) record it separately and load it into RAM before or after the main program is loaded — saves space on tape: (2) treat the program and subroutines as one program — convenient. 

GUESSING GAME 

This is a simple game demonstrating use of the PRINT subroutine. The program itself explains the game, which is left with hexadecimal output for variation. 

If your 660 is not called Little Zen (which becomes clear when you run the program), you might like to change the first message! Don t forget to load the PRINT subroutine.
