BLOCK PUZZLE 

David Poole, Kenthurst NSW 

This is a simulation of the traditional block puzzles everyone used to play at school under the desk while the teacherâ€™s back was turned. Block puzzles consist of a matrix of interlocking tablets, usually in a square of 4 x 4 or 5 x 5, with one tablet missing allowing you to shuffle the tablets or blocks. Each block has a numeral or letter apd the object is to arrange them in order: 1 2 3 4 in the first row, 6 7 8 9 in the second row etc, leaving the blank in one corner. There are various other arrangements, but you get the idea. 

This version displays 16 white blocks on the screen in a 4 x 4 matrix with a numeral or letter in 15, one being blank. You get the numerals 1 to 9 and letters A to F. You can move the blank by pressing the keys as follows: 

UP press KEY 2 
DOWN press KEY 8 
LEFT press KEY 6 
RIGHT press KEY 4 

When you start the program, the block puzzle is written on the screen and the computer randomly
shuffles all the blocks. When it stops, you can start moving the blank. This game is guaranteed to take longer to play than it is to key in!
