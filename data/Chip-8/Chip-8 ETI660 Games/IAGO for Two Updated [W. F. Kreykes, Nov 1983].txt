This is a modification of the IAGO for Two program which was designed by Frank Rees and published in ETI in February '83. 

This version draws the board in the middle of the screen, has sound effects and numbered co-ordinates which all makes it that much more interesting to play. 

Key 0 concede a move/change position. 
Keys 1-8 board co-ordinates. 
Keys 9-F confirm move. 

Game ends if either playerâ€™s score reaches zero, or when the board is full. 

To replay the game, reset 8.
