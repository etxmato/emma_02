POLARIS 

Tim Parish 

You have control of a submarine, using the keys 5 (move left), 7 (move right), 6 (move up) and E (dive). Key D is used to fire missiles at planes which fly from left to right. (Users with a hex keypad can change the instructions at addresses 0720, 0726, 072c and 0732 to select different keys for control.) 

If you stay still, the depth charge dropped from the plane will not miss! You must also avoid the torpedo which is regularly launched from the left. 

When you are hit by either the torpedo or the depth charge, your score is displayed, based on the number of planes shot down. 

An added catch â€” a marker showing maximum depth for the submarine rises steadily with increasing score! It stops close to the surface, making things harder for the high scoring player 

Pressing key 8 will start a new game. (Would Tim Parish please contact the Editor.)
