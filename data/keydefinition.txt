Where:
- X is set 1 or 2
- 0 to F for 'pad' definitions are PC key values,  0 is 'not used'.
- game keys; up1: up player 1,  left1: left player 1 etc. Values are hex keys 0 to F. 10 is 'not used' and 11 is the Elf IN button. The game key definition is just to visualize the correct arcade keys in the keymap window.
- Definitions for nnp are for use without numeric keypad.
- 'sim a2' and 'sim b2' define diagonal directions for Studio II clones,  i.e. up/left direction when pressing both arrow up and arrow left for player A. '!' versions disable the diagonal directions.
