By default the following ROMs will be selected:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>diag_pal1.bin, mapped to hex 0-FFF instead of BASIC ROM (if the diagnostic board is set to 'on'). BASIC ROM will be switched back 
 on the first INP 1 instruction.
<li>diag_pal2_v1.1.bin, mapped to hex C0000-D7FF. This v1.1 version will perform the extended ROM check on BASIC ROM file comx35.1.1.bin.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Next to this additional RAM will be selected from hex D800-DFFF.
</p>
<p>

<li>diag_ntsc1.bin, diag_ntsc2.bin, NTSC version with ROM check for the original COMX BASIC ROM (comx35.bin).
</ul>
