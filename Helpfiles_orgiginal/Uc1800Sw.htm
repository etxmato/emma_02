<h2>Pre SW Load</h2>
<p>
To run the Infinite UC1800 emulator with SW loaded before the emulator starts select the SW file in the 'RAM' field. To change the location use the 'RAM' button to browse for the file, do the same to change the filename or type in a new file name in the text field.
</p>
<p>
The selected file will be loaded at RAM address 0 (if the file is binary, other formats like intel hex will be loaded at the specified locations). 
</p>

The binary, Intel hex and RCS Elf Emulator hex format are supported.
