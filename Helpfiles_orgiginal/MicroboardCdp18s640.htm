<h2>CDP18S640: A/A1 Display</h2>
<p>
The CDP18S640A and CDP18S640A1 boards include:
<UL>
<LI>A 1 KB RAM (hex 8C00-8FFF) and 2 KB ROM socket (hex 8000-87FF)
<LI>Four control switches: RESET, RUN P, RUN U, STEP/CONT
<LI>Six hexadecimal display digits
<LI>Six LED status displays
</UL>
</p>
<p>
To define a system using the CDP18S640 select 'CDP18S640 A/A1 Display' from one of the CARD Choice boxes. Note that only one CDP18S640 front panel can be emulated in Emma 02 as such Emma 02 will issue a warning (CARD button will turn red) if two CDP18S640 boards are defined.
</p>
<p>
To specify the ROM / RAM content files press the CARD x button and the CDP18S640 Setup window will open. Press 'SAVE' to save the configuration.
</p>
<p>
Emulation of the LEDs can take a lot of PC CPU power so default these are only updated every 100 ms. This can be changed in the Emma 02 window by changing the 'LEDs' field. When 0 ms (or nothing) is specified the LEDs will be updated in real time. Note that this will take a lot of CPU load and as such make the Microboard System run very slow due to the frequent changes in both CPU status, data and address LEDs.
</p>
<p>
In STEP mode all LEDs are updated in real time.
</p>
<h3>Front Panel</h3>
<p>
RESET - Places the CPU into the reset state
</p>
<p>
RUN P - Execute program in RAM at address 0
</p>
<p>
RUN U - Execute program in ROM at address hex 8000
</p>
<p>
STEP/CONT - STEP mode will single step the processor by executing next CPU cycle and then entering Wait mode
</p>
<p>
DATA BUS - 2 seven-segment led displays showing the value of the data bus
</p>
<p>
MEMPRY ADDRESS - 4 seven-segment led displays showing the value of the address bus
</p>
<p>
STATUS LEDS - CPU Status LEDs SC1/SC0 showing the state type, WT for Wait, CLR for Clear, Q and RUN.
