<h2>Installation Elf/Os 3.0</h2>
<p>
Elf Os is a disk based operating system for Elf class computers designed by Mike Riley, for additional information see also: <a href="http://www.elf-emulation.com">Elf/1802 Emulation</a>.
</p>
<p>
For Elf/Os installation:
<ul>
<li>Start an Elf 2000 using ROM Elf2Kv110.bin (or later) and a VT simulator (serial or UART)
<li>Select 'HEX' mode (instead of XMODEM) via the toggle button
<li>Select file elfos_ram.hex via the HEX button
<li>Unselect 'Auto'
<li>Press play
<li>When file transfer is done press return
<li>Now type run 3000 (and return to set baud rate)
<li>Execute step 1 to 5
<li>Reset the Elf 2000
<li>Select file supplement.hex via the HEX button
<li>Press play
<li>When file transfer is done press return 
<li>Now type run 3000 (and return to set baud rate)
<li>Execute step 4 to install xrb.bin
<li>Boot in ElfOs by typing boot or b
</ul>
<p>
When using Elf/Os in combination with Intel-8275 video, please note the following:
<UL>
<LI>I suggest to perform the installation on a serial or UART installation
<LI>The LOAD command will not work due to the fact that it uses the same memory location as the video memory. To solve this a LOAD command is included which is located at address hex 7400-74AE. This version is provided in file LOAD-8275.hex.
<LI>The @ command in the MINIMON will not work correctly due to the fact that it uses R0 as program counter which is not allowed when using Intel-8275 video. To solve this a MINIMON program is provided which uses R3 as program counter. This version is provided in file MINIMON-8275.hex.
</UL>
</p>
<p>
The elf2k_installation.ide file includes a pre installed Elf/Os 3.2. The installation file will be renamed to elf2k.ide if the used file doesn't exist.
