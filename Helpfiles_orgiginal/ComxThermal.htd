<h2>Thermal Printer CALL and CARD Routines</h2>
<p>
The printer can be activated by using the CARD Tm commands as described below and in the <a href="ComxExpansion.htm">Expansion Box</a> section. If no expansion box is used the same commands can be activated by CALL statements:

<p>
Note: if the expansion box is used the user should enable the standard printer card first before any assembly call is initiated. This can be done by the OUT 1 instruction or in BASIC by using any CARD Tm statement before the CALL statement.
</p>
<p>
When using the Screen capture function it is recommended not to use the F&M Screen editor or before use to turn it off by using POKE (@43F8,1). To start screen capture use CALL (@C0F0,1) to allow the COMX to store all screen data in regular RAM, after the data is printed on the screen use CALL (@C0F0,2,y) to print the screen lines 0 to y to the thermal printer. Stop the screen capture by using CALL (@C0F0,3).
