<h1>Reversed Branch data</h1>
<p>
Maybe not as commonly used as <a href="DirectBranchData.htm">Branch Data</a>, there could be use cases to define reversed branched in 1802 code. So first byte is the lower 8 bit and the second the higher 8 bit of a 16 bit address. For these cases the 'reversed branch data' bytes can be defined in the Direct assembler by marking the data bytes as 'Rev Br' via the procedure described in section <a href="DirectMarking.htm">Changing Address Usage</a>. By doing this the reversed branch data will be corrected when using <a href="DirectInsert.htm">insert, delete</a> or <a href="DirectCopy.htm">copy</a> commands. All 'Reversed branch data' will be shown in <FONT COLOR=#b251a7>pink</FONT> text.

For example doing an insert on address hex 4510 in the following example:

will result in:
