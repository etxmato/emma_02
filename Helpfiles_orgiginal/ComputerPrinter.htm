To print to a file select 'File' in the selection box (orange). If the indicate print file (magenta) already exists, a new file will be created (with a sequence number) every time the emulated computer window is initiated. E.g. if the print file is 'printerout.txt', this file is used the first time, next time the file printerout.1.txt' will be created.
</p>
<p>
To specify a different print file use the 'Printer' button (green) to browse for the file, or type in a new file name in the text field (magenta).

The first font rom also includes 2 sets designed for use with MSX computers. To access the fonts use code '12' and character set:
</p>
<pre>
0. Original PL-80 Pica font (character 32 to 255)</pre>
<p>
With the italic font rom selected:
</p>
<pre>
1. Italic font
2. Emphasized font
3. Outline font
4. MSX font (character 1 to 31, by adding 32)
5. MSX font (character 32 to 255)</pre>
<p>
<p>
With the tiny font rom selected:
</p>
<pre>

An example is also included to print the different character sets, see the file 'Fonts.comx' in the 'Comx/Plotter' directory.
