<p>
The CDP18S626 board includes:
<UL>
<LI>32 to 64 KB RAM or ROM
<LI>Inhibit feature to disable part of the RAM/ROM chips
</UL>
</p>
<p>
To define a system using the CDP18S626 select 'CDP18S626 32/64K RAM/ROM' from one of the CARD Choice boxes. 
</p>
<p>
To specify the RAM or ROM location, content files  and/or inhibit function press the CARD x button and the CDP18S626 Setup window will open. When using the 32K memory size the CDP18S626 has four RAM or ROM banks, in 64K it has 4 ROM banks. The size of the banks depends on the total memory size selected 32K 4 times 8K and with 64K 4 times 16K. In 32K mode start location can be selected as either 0 or hex 8000, i.e. memory runs from hex 0-7FFF or hex 8000-8FFF.
</p>
<p>
Memory inhibit possibilities depend on the memory size and start location.
</p>
<p>
Note that the defined RAM or ROM should not overlap with any other defined RAM or ROM in any of the other cards, if this does happen Emma 02 will give a warning (CARD button will turn red and a message will appear in the setup window). Even if warnings are issued the configuration might run in Emma 02 however the board in the highest CARD will override the memory type of lower boards.
