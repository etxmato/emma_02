<p>
Currently layouts for Dutch, German, French, Swedish / Finnish and US are provided as well as an option to specify a user specific definition. If you desire a specific mapping for your keyboard please drop me an email with your requirements and I'll try to add it in the next release.
</p>
<p>
To create a definition for your own layout first locate one of the keyboard definition files located in the data directory (see section <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>), for example us.ini (for the US keyboard layout). Copy this file and rename the new file into user_defined.ini. Change any key value in the file to your desired default setting.
