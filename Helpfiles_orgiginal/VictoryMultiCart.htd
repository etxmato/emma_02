<h2>40th Anniversary Multi-cart</h2>
<p>
To use the 40th Anniversary Multi-cart as designed by FLiP select the 'Multi-cart' configuration (see also <a href="MainConfigurations.htm">Configurations</a>). Alternatively select the '40th Anniversary Multi-cart' checkbox and select the multi-cart ROM file as 'CART'.
</p>
<p>
At start-up the current selected ROM is shown in the title of the RCA Studio III / Victory MPT-02 window. Change ROM by switching MSB or LSB which will both update the RCA Studio III / Victory MPT-02 title and restart the computer. Note that a real RCA Studio III / Victory MPT-02 with multi-cart will NOT restart autmoatically.
</p>
<p>
The multi-cart can either use the original Victory MPT-02 ROM as specified in the ROM field or use the system ROM as is defined in the multi-cart ROM. To select the multi-cart system ROM select 'Disable System ROM'. This will be needed to run most Studio II games correctly (i.e. without part of the screen duplicated).
