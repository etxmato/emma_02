<h2>Keyboard Mapping and Types</h2>
<p>
This section describes Elf keyboard mapping for details, for VT100 terminal key mappings see section <a href="TerminalVT100.htm">VT100 Setup & Key Mapping</a>
</p>
<h3>Keyboard Mapping</h3>
<p>
Default the Elf 2000 'In' button is mapped to the PC Insert key on Windows and PC Control key on Mac OSX. F12 is mapped to the Elf 2000 'Run' switch or 'G' button, so if the CPU is stopped it will start with F12 and when running it will stop with F12, stop mode is indicated in the emulated window title. See also <a href="KeyMappingMain.htm">Key Mapping</a> and <a href="MainFunctionKeys.htm">Function and Hot Keys</a>.
</p>
<h3>Keyboard Types</h3>
<p>
To select the specific Elf 2000 keyboard type use the choice button 'Keyboard' (yellow ellipse). Currently 3 types are supported: PS2 Keyboard, PS2 + JP4 and Hex Keyboard.
