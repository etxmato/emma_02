<h1>The RCA 1802</h1>
<p>
The <a href="DebuggerSyntax1802.htm">RCA CDP1802</a> (aka RCA COSMAC, COSMAC 1802) is an 8-bit CMOS microprocessor introduced by RCA in early 1976. COSMAC is an acronym for COmplementary Silicon Metal-oxide Conductor which was RCA's term for its first CMOS (COS/MOS) semiconductor technology. The 1802 has an architecture quite different from most other 8-bit microprocessors.

The RCA 1802, which is actually the one-chip implementation of the earlier two-chip RCA 1801, has a static CMOS design with no minimum clock frequency, so that it can run at very low speeds and low power. It has an 8-bit parallel bus with a bidirectional data bus and a multiplexed address bus (i.e., the high order byte of the 16-bit address and the low order byte of the address take turns in using the 8-bit physical address bus lines, by accessing the bus lines in different clock cycles). It has a single bit, programmable output port, and four input pins which are directly tested by branch instructions. Its I/O mode is flexible and programmable, and it has a single-phase clock with an on-chip oscillator. Its register set consists of sixteen 16-bit registers. The program counter (PC) can reside in any of these, providing a simple way to implement multiple PCs, pointers, or registers.

RCA also produced the <a href="DebuggerSyntax1804.htm">CDP1804</a> microcontroller based on the RCA 1802 architecture. The 1804 had 64 bytes of memory, 2 KB ROM, on-chip oscillator and 8-bit timer. Instruction set of the 1804 was enhanced with 32 additional instructions, including subroutine call and return from the subroutine instructions. The <a href="DebuggerSyntax1805.htm">CDP1805</a> and CDP1806 were similar to the 1804, but they didn't have on-chip ROM.
