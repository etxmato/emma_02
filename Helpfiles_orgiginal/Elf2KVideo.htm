<h2>1861 Pixie graphics</h2>
<p>
1861 Pixie graphics is the same graphic system used for the Studio II computer giving a black and white screen of 64 by 128 large pixels.
</p>
<h2>Intel 8275</h2>
<p>
The intel 8275 is a video chip for text based output. Different screen sizes can be emulated via software setings of the intel 8275 registers. The Elf 2000 firmware supports this video type but only when a PS2 keyboard is emulated at the same time. Character font ROM is specified and changeable via the 'Intel8275' button (orange ellipse).
