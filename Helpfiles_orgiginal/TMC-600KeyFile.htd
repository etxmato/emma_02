<h2>Key File</h2>
<p>
With the Key File function it is possible to specify a set of keys (or text) to be typed into the emulated TMC-600 automatically as defined in the file. Note that the Key File needs to be specified before start of the emulated computer or before performing a 'Reset'.
</p>
<p>
To specify the location and file use the 'Key File' button to browse for the file or type in a new file name in the text field.
</p>
<p>
If the key file uses both capital and lower case characters press the Caps Lock at start-up to allow input of lower case characters.
</p>
<p>
Note: Specify one extra 'C' at the start of the file to allow the TMC-600 to start basic.
