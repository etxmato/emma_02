<p>
To specify the ROM location, content files  and/or inhibit function press the CARD x button and the CDP18S625 Setup window will open. The CDP18S625 has two ROM banks for which the size of the ROM chips can be selected (1Kx8, 2Kx8 and 4Kx8). ROM locations can be selected by specifying a 1K, 2K or 4K block (depending on chip size). Press 'SAVE' to save the configuration.

Note that the defined ROM should not overlap with any other defined RAM or ROM in any of the other cards, if this does happen Emma 02 will give a warning (CARD button will turn red and a message will appear in the setup window). Even if warnings are issued the configuration might run in Emma 02 however the board in the highest CARD will override the memory type of lower boards.
