<h2>Pre SW Load</h2>
<p>
To run the VELF emulator with SW loaded before the emulator starts select the SW file in the 'RAM SW' field. To change the location use the 'RAM SW' button to browse for the file, do the same to change the filename or type in a new file name in the text field.
</p>
<p>
The selected file will be loaded at RAM address 0 (if the file is binary, other formats like intel hex will be loaded at the specified locations). This can for example be used to start the emulator with the chip-8 interpreter loaded. To also load chip-8 SW directly at address hex 200 (or hex 300 when using Chip-8X) use the 'Chip-8/X' button.
</p>
<p>
Chip-8, Chip-8X interpreters are stored in the Velf directory and Chip-8 SW is stored in the Chip-8 directory at installation (located in the application data directory, see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>). 
</p>
<p>
The binary, Intel hex and RCS Elf Emulator hex format are supported.
