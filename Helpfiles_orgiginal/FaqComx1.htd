<h1>How do I run a game or program on the COMX emulator?</h1>
<p>
The easiest way to run your favourite game or program on the COMX emulator is to load and run a '.comx' file by using the memory RUN feature (see steps below). All available SW is stored in the Comx directory (located in the application data directory, see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>) at installation.
