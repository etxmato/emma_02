<h2>CDP18S646: Printer</h2>
<p>
The CDP18S646 board includes:
<UL>
<LI>Centronics-type parallel printer interface
</UL>
</p>
<p>
To define a system using the CDP18S646 select 'CDP18S646 Printer' from one of the CARD Choice boxes. Note that only one CDP18S646 can be emulated in Emma 02 as such Emma 02 will issue a warning (CARD button will turn red) if two CDP18S646 boards are defined.
</p>
<p>
To specify the I/O Group, printer type (window/file) and/or output filename press the CARD x button and the CDP18S646 Setup window will open. Press 'SAVE' to save the configuration.
</p>
<p>
Note that the CDP18S646 also includes a Disk interface which is currently not supported in Emma 02. Mainly because I don't have any SW to test this disk type interface and as such it is impossible to provide this emulation. If you have any SW using this disk interface please contact me!
