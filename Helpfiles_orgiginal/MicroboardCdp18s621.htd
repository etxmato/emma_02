<h2>CDP18S621: 16K RAM</h2>

The CDP18S621 board includes:
<UL>
<LI>16 KB RAM selectable at any 16K memory location
<LI>Inhibit feature to disable any of the four 4 KB RAM chips
</UL>
</p>
<p>
To define a system using the CDP18S621 select 'CDP18S621 16K RAM' from one of the CARD Choice boxes. 
</p>
<p>
To specify the RAM location, content files and/or inhibit function press the CARD x button and the CDP18S621 Setup window will open. Press 'SAVE' to save the configuration.
</p>
<p>
Note that the defined RAM should not overlap with any other defined RAM or ROM in any of the other cards, if this does happen Emma 02 will give a warning (CARD button will turn red and a message will appear in the setup window). Even if warnings are issued the configuration might run in Emma 02 however the board in the highest CARD will override the memory type of lower boards.
