<h1>I have a tape with old SW how do I load that into Emma 02?</h1>
<p>
There are two ways to load SW from tapes into Emma 02 (and as a result save them on your hard disk in binary, hex or other formats):
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>First convert the tape to a wav file and then load the wav file as described in the 'Cassette Support' sections for the different applicable computers.
<li>Load the tape in real time into Emma 02 via your PC HW as described in the <a href="MainRealCassette.htm">Real Cassette Support</a> section.
</ol> 
</p>
<p>
Both options are described in more detail on the <a href="http://www.emma02.hobby-site.com/cassette.html">Tape Conversion</a> page on my Emma 02 site.
