<h2>Control Windows</h2>
<p>
2 types of Cosmicos control windows can be emulated. The main board and the hex & 7 segment panel. 
</p>
<p>
The main board includes the buttons, status LEDs and TIL313 displays for the data byte. Emulation of the TIL311 displays and the LEDs can take a lot of PC CPU power so default these are only updated every 100 ms. This can be changed in the Emma 02 window by changing the 'LEDs' field. When 0 ms (or nothing) is specfied the TIL311 displays and LEDs will be updated in real time.

<p>
The hex & 7 segment panel includes the hex keyboard connected to OUT/INP 5 and 8 TIL313 displays controlled by OUT/INP 6.
