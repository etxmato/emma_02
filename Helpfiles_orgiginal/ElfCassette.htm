<h1>Cassette Support</h1>
<p>
The common functionality for cassette handling is described in the section <a href="MainCassette.htm">Cassette Support</a>. For details on how to use a real cassette player connected to a PC and Emma 02 please see the section: <a href="MainRealCassette.htm">Real Cassette Support</a>.
</p>
<p>
Cassett support is not enabled by default! The <a href="ElfGiant.htm">Giant Board</a> configuration which includes a working Cassette configuration can be loaded via the follwoing menu:

<p>
The following sub section describe Elf specific cassette handling for both automatic and manual options.
</p>
<h2>Auto</h2>
<p>
To use this option 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' should be checked (yellow ellipse) which is the default setting:

<p>
To load a .wav file into the Elf with the Giant Board configuration, press 04-IN, enter the two-byte address of the memory to be loaded and then enter the ending two-byte address (every byte followed by IN). Start the actual load with an additional IN on Elf emulator window and the cassette play button (green ellipse) will go green.
</p>
<p>
To save a .wav file from the Elf with the Giant Board configuration, press 03-IN, enter the two-byte address of the memory to be saved and then enter the ending two-byte address (every byte followed by IN). Start the actual save with an additional IN on the Elf emulator window and the cassette record button (red ellipse) will go red. 
</p>
<p>
For both save and load make sure a .wav file is selected in the Emma 02 window before using the save and load instructions otherwise the Elf emulator will hang on the load (until you manually start a .wav file) or with a save the wav sound will not be written to any file.
</p>
<h3>Manual</h3>
<p>
To use this option 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' should NOT be checked. This setting is more like the cassette handling is on the real Elf however a bit more complicated than Auto LOAD/SAVE:

<p>
To load a .wav file into the Elf with the Giant Board configuration, press 04-IN, enter the two-byte address of the memory to be loaded and then enter the ending two-byte address (every byte followed by IN). Now press play (green ellipse) and after that as soon as possible press an additional IN on the Elf.
</p>
<p>
To save a .wav file from the Elf with the Giant Board configuration, press the dark red record button (red ellipse) and then press 03-IN, enter the two-byte address of the memory to be saved and then enter the ending two-byte address (every byte followed by IN). Start the actual save with an additional IN on the Elf.
</p>
<p>
Saving or loading can be stopped at anytime by pressing the stop button (brown ellipse). When stopping a load while the Elf is in loading mode will however hang the Elf.
