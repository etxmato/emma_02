<h2>Pre SW Load</h2>
<p>
To run the Cosmac Vip II emulator with SW loaded before the emulator starts select the SW file in the 'RAM SW' field. To change the location use the 'RAM SW' button to browse for the file, do the same to change the filename or type in a new file name in the text field.
</p>
<p>
On the Cosmac Vip II 'ED' the selected file will be loaded at RAM address 4000 in FPB mode and 0000 in ROM mode (if the file is binary, other formats like intel hex will be loaded at the specified locations). This can for example be used to start the emulator with the chip-8 interpreter loaded. To also load chip-8 SW directly at address hex 200 (or hex 300 when using Chip-8X) use the 'Chip-8/X' button. 
</p>
<p>
On the Cosmac Vip II 'RCA' the selected file will be loaded at RAM address 0 (if the file is binary, other formats like intel hex will be loaded at the specified locations). This can for example be used to start the emulator with the chip-8 interpreter loaded. To also load chip-8 SW directly at address hex 200 (or hex 300 when using Chip-8X) use the 'Chip-8/X' button. When Chip-8 is loaded it can be started by booting to RAM or using command CH8 from FPB. The CH8 command is only available in the VIP II 'RCA' FPB version. 
</p>
<p>
Chip-8 and Chip-8X interpreters are stored in the Vip directory and Chip-8 SW is stored in the Chip-8 directory at installation (located in the application data directory, see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>). 
</p>
<p>
The binary, Intel hex and RCS Elf Emulator hex format are supported.
