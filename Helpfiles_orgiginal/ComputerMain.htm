To select an XML file select the desired computer (orange) and then the xml file itself (blue).
</p>
<p>
When selecting the xml file a short description of the selected configuration for that file is shown in the Configuration field (green). The rest of the GUI will be enabled or disabled based on the XML file content. As stated above start any selected emulation by selecting 'Start' (yellow).

The computer list (orange) is generated based on the folder structure in the Xml folder within the data folder (see also <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>). A different Xml folder can be selected via the XML button (brown).

If a new folder is created within the Xml folder it will show up as a computer on next startup or when reselecting the XML folder via the XML button (brown). If defined the extended computer name will replace the computer folder name if defined in the xml file via the &lt;system&gt;&lt;name&gt; tag. As such it is recommended to use one and the same name tag in all xml files within one computer folder.

<p>
Each computer includes one or more xml files depending on number of available configurations.
